## Songe (id: 466842)

songe, rêve
===========

Définition:
-----------

Un songe est une combination d'images et de sons qui apparaissent, que les gens voient dans leur esprit pendant le sommeil.

* le mot rêve est un synonyme qui n'est pas employé dans l'Ancient Testament mais remplace songe dans la langue moderne.
* Les songes paraissent souvent être réels, mais ils ne le sont pas.
* Parfois, Dieu apparaît aux gens dans des songes au sujet de quelque chose afin qu'ils puissent en tirer des leçons. Il peut aussi parler directement en songes aux personnes.
* Dans la Bible, Dieu a parlé à certaines personnes en songes spéciaux pour leur donner un message, souvent au sujet d'évènements futurs.
* Un songe est différent d'une vision. Les songes se produisent lorsqu' une personne est endormie, mais les visions prennent place généralement lorsqu'une personne est éveillée.
