But “curtain” is a better term in that context, since it refers to a heavy, thick piece of cloth.</p></li></ul><h2>Translation Suggestions</h2><ul><li><p>The term “veil” could also be translated as “thin cloth covering” or “cloth covering” or “head covering” or “head covering.”</p></li><li><p>In some cultures, there may already be a term for a veil for women. It may be necessary to find a different word when it is used for Moses.</p></li></ul><p>(See also: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26031\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Moses</span>)</p><h2>Bible References:</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor3:12-2Cor3:13\">2 Corinthians 3:12–13</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor3:16\">2 Corinthians 3:16</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek13:18\">Ezekiel 13:18</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa47:1-Isa47:2\">Isaiah 47:1–2</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:3\">Song of Songs 4:3</a></p></li></ul><h2>Word Data:</h2><ul><li><p>Strong’s: H4304, H4533, H4555, H6777, H6809, H7196, H7479, G03430, G25710, G25720</p></li></ul>",
