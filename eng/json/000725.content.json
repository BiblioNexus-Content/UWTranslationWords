The term “punishment” refers to the negative consequence that is given as a result of that wrong behavior.</p><ul><li><p>Often punishment is intended to motivate a person to stop sinning.</p></li><li><p>God punished the Israelites when they disobeyed him, especially when they worshiped false gods. Because of their sin, God allowed their enemies to attack and capture them.</p></li><li><p>God is righteous and just, so he has to punish sin. Every human being has sinned against God and deserves punishment.</p></li><li><p>Jesus was punished for all the evil things that every person has ever done. He received each person’s punishment on himself even though he did nothing wrong and did not deserve that punishment.</p></li><li><p>The expressions “go unpunished” and “leave unpunished” mean to decide not to punish people for their wrongdoing. God often allows sin to go unpunished as he waits for people to repent.</p></li></ul><p>(See also: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25932\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">just</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26170\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">repent</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26177\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">righteous</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26240\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">sin</span>)</p><h2>Bible References:</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John4:18\">1 John 4:18</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess1:9\">2 Thessalonians 1:9</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:21\">Acts 4:21</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:59-Acts7:60\">Acts 7:59–60</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:15\">Genesis 4:15</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke23:16\">Luke 23:16</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt25:46\">Matthew 25:46</a></p></li></ul><h2>Examples from the Bible stories:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>13:7</strong> God also gave many other laws and rules to follow.
