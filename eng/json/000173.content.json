This is not the meaning of “Christian” in the Bible.</p></li><li><p>Because the term “Christian” in the Bible always refers to someone who truly believes in Jesus, a Christian is also called a “believer.”</p></li></ul><h2>Translation Suggestions:</h2><ul><li><p>This term could be translated as “Christ-follower” or “follower of Christ” or perhaps something like, “Christ-person.”</p></li><li><p>Make sure that the translation of this term is translated differently than terms used for disciple or apostle.</p></li><li><p>Be careful to translate this term with a word that can refer to everyone who believes in Jesus, not just certain groups.</p></li><li><p>Also consider how this term is translated in a Bible translation in a local or national language.
