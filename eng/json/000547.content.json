They may have been “astrologers,” people who study the stars.</p><ul><li><p>These men traveled a long way from a country far to the east of Israel. It is not known exactly where they came from or who they were. But they were obviously scholars who had studied the stars.</p></li><li><p>They may have been descendants of the wise men who served the Babylonian kings in Daniel’s time and who were trained in many things, including studying the stars and interpreting dreams.</p></li><li><p>Traditionally it has been said that there were three wise men or learned men because of the three gifts they brought to Jesus. However, the Bible text does not say how many there were.</p></li></ul><p>(See also: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25500\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Babylon</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25530\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Bethlehem</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25642\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Daniel</span>)</p><h2>Bible References:</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan2:27\">Daniel 2:27</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan5:7\">Daniel 5:7</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:1\">Matthew 2:1</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:7\">Matthew 2:7</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:16\">Matthew 2:16</a></p></li></ul><h2>Word Data:</h2><ul><li><p>Strong’s: H1505, G30970</p></li></ul>",
