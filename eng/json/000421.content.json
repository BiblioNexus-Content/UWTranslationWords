They were usually built on higher ground, such as on a hill or mountainside.</p><ul><li><p>Many of the kings of Israel sinned against God by building altars to false gods on these high places. This led the people to become deeply involved in worshiping idols.</p></li><li><p>It often happened that when a God-fearing king started ruling in Israel or Judah, often he would remove the high places or altars in order to stop the worship of these idols.</p></li><li><p>However, some of these good kings were careless and did not remove the high places, which resulted in the entire nation of Israel would continue to worship idols.</p></li></ul><h2>Translation Suggestions:</h2><ul><li><p>Other ways to translate this term could include “elevated places for idol worship” or “hilltop idol shrines” or “idol altar mounds.”</p></li><li><p>Make sure it is clear that this term refers to the idol altars, not just to the high place where those altars were located.</p></li></ul><p>(See also: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25447\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">altar</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25728\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">false god</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26357\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">worship</span>)</p><h2>Bible References:</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam9:12-1Sam9:13\">1 Samuel 9:12–13</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:4\">2 Kings 16:4</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos4:13\">Amos 4:13</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut33:29\">Deuteronomy 33:29</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek6:1-Ezek6:3\">Ezekiel 6:1–3</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hab3:19\">Habakkuk 3:19</a></p></li></ul><h2>Word Data:</h2><ul><li><p>Strong’s: H1116, H1181, H1354, H2073, H4791, H7311, H7413</p></li></ul>",
