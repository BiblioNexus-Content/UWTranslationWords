If so, this term could be used.</p></li><li><p>Another way to translate this would be, “a foundation stone used for the corner of a building.”</p></li><li><p>It is important to keep the fact that this is a large stone, used as a solid and secure building material. If stones are not used for constructing buildings, there may be another word that could be used that means “large stone” (such as “boulder”) but it should also have the idea of being well-formed and made to fit.</p></li></ul><h2>Bible References:</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:11\">Acts 4:11</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:20\">Ephesians 2:20</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt21:42\">Matthew 21:42</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps118:22\">Psalms 118:22</a></p></li></ul><h2>Word Data:</h2><ul><li><p>Strong’s: H0068, H6438, H7218, G02040, G11370, G27760, G30370</p></li></ul>",
