She was a virgin and was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph. The angel said, “You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You are to name him Jesus and he will be the Messiah.”</p></li><li><p><strong>22:5</strong> The angel explained, “The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of God will overshadow you. So the baby will be holy, the Son of God.” <strong>Mary</strong> believed and accepted what the angel said.</p></li><li><p><strong>22:6</strong> Soon after the angel spoke to <strong>Mary</strong>, she went and visited Elizabeth. As soon as Elizabeth heard <strong>Mary’s</strong> greeting, Elizabeth’s baby jumped inside her.</p></li><li><p><strong>23:2</strong> The angel said, “Joseph, do not be afraid to take <strong>Mary</strong> as your wife. The baby in her body is from the Holy Spirit.”</p></li><li><p><strong>23:4</strong> Joseph and <strong>Mary</strong> had to make a long journey from where they lived in Nazareth to Bethlehem because their ancestor was David whose hometown was Bethlehem.</p></li><li><p><strong>49:1</strong> An angel told a virgin named <strong>Mary</strong> that she would give birth to God’s Son. So while she was still a virgin, she gave birth to a son and named him Jesus.</p></li></ul><h2>Word Data:</h2><ul><li><p>Strong’s: G31370</p></li></ul>",
