This elevated object can be any number of things, such as a tree or a gallows, that is, a platform built specifically for the purpose of hanging a person in order to kill him.</p></li><li><p>In biblical times, however, ancient cultures may not have killed people by hanging in precisely the same way. For example, Jesus died while hanging on a wooden cross (sometimes called a “tree”), but there was nothing around his neck. The soldiers suspended him by nailing his hands (or wrists) and his feet to the cross.</p></li><li><p>Some ancient cultures “hung” a person by impaling him on a wooden pole in such a way that he was suspended above the ground so that he could not escape. The person would be left there until he died.</p></li><li><p>For many references to death by “hanging” in the Bible, the specific means of death is unknown.</p></li></ul><h2>Bible References:</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam17:23\">2 Samuel 17:23</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts10:39\">Acts 10:39</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal3:13\">Galatians 3:13</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen40:22\">Genesis 40:22</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:3-Matt27:5\">Matthew 27:3–5</a></p></li></ul><h2>Word Data:</h2><ul><li><p>Strong’s: H2614, H3363, H8518, G05190</p></li></ul>",
