## Samuel (id: 27052)

Samuel
======

Facts:
------

Samuel was a prophet and the last judge of Israel. He anointed both Saul and David as kings over Israel.

* Samuel was born to Elkanah and Hannah in the town of Ramah.
* Hannah had been barren, so she had prayed earnestly that God would give her a son. Samuel was the answer to that prayer.
* Hannah promised that if, in answer to her desperate prayer that God would give her a male child, her request was granted, she would dedicate her son to Yahweh.
* To fulfill her promise to God, when Samuel was a young boy, Hannah sent him to live with and help Eli the priest in the temple.
* God raised up Samuel to be a great prophet.
