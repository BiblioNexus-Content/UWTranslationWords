## Disperse (id: 26531)

disperse, dispersion, scatter, distributed
==========================================

Definition:
-----------

The terms “disperse” and “dispersion” refer to the scattering of people or things into many different directions.

* In the Old Testament, God talks about “dispersing” people, causing them to have to separate and live in different places apart from each other. He did this to punish them for their sin. Perhaps being dispersed would help them repent and start worshiping God again.
* The term “dispersion” is used in the New Testament to refer to Christians who had to leave their homes and move to many different locations to escape persecution.
* The phrase “the dispersion” could be translated as “believers in many different places” or “the people who moved away to live in different nations.”
* The term “disperse” could be translated as “send away into many different places” or “scatter abroad” or “cause to move away to live in different countries.”
