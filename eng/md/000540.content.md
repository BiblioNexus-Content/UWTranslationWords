## Lampstand (id: 26813)

lampstand
=========

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, the term “lampstand” refers to a structure on which a lamp is placed in order to provide light to a room.

* The lampstand would be tall enough so that the light of the lamp could shine throughout the room.
* The lampstand could be made of wood or metal and could hold one or more lamps.
* Ordinary lamps were made of clay, and lamps for special purposes, such as for the temple, were made of metal (such as bronze, silver, or gold.)
* The lamps were in the shape of a bowl with a raised lip on one side that held a wick. The lamps were filled with olive oil that soaked the wick and burned when the wick was lighted.
* In the Jerusalem temple there was a special gold lampstand that had seven branches for holding seven lamps.

Translation Suggestions
-----------------------

* This term could be also translated as “lamp pedestal” or “structure for holding a lamp” or “lamp holder.”
* For the temple lampstand, this could be translated as “seven\-lamp lampstand” or “gold pedestal with seven lamps.”
* It would also be helpful in a translation to include pictures of a simple lampstand and a seven\-branch lampstand in the relevant Bible passages.
