## Daniel (id: 26500)

Daniel
======

Facts:
------

Daniel was an Israelite prophet who as a young man was taken captive by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar around 600 BC.

* This was during the time that many other Israelites from Judah were held captive in Babylon for 70 years.
* Daniel was given the Babylonian name Belteshazzar.
* Daniel was an honorable and righteous young man who obeyed God.
* God enabled Daniel to interpret several dreams or visions for the Babylonian kings.
* Because of this ability and because of his honorable character, Daniel was given a high leadership position in the Babylonian empire.
* Many years later, Daniels enemies tricked the Babylonian king Darius into making a law forbidding the worship of anyone except the king. Daniel continued to pray to God, so he was arrested and thrown into a den of lions. But God rescued him and he was not harmed at all.
