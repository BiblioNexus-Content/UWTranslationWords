## Seal (id: 27064)

seal, sealed, unsealed
======================

Definition:
-----------

When referring to an action, the term “seal” means to close an object with something (usually called a “seal”) that makes the object impossible to open without breaking the seal. When referring to an object, the term “seal” refers to something that was made of wood or metal or stone that was formed into a design so that it could be used to stamp something (make an imprint on it).

* A seal was marked with a design to show who it belonged to.
* Seals were used to mark different objects for the purpose of showing that the thing belonged to the owner or had come from the owner or was approved by the owner.
* Seals were used to indicate the authenticity of something as deriving from the owner or being approved by the owner or belonging to the owner in some way.
* Sometimes a seal was put on the top of a ring so that the owner of the ring could press the seal down into something and make an imprint on it.
* Sometimes seals were attached to a string or cord and worn around the neck.
* Melted wax was used to seal letters or other documents that needed to be protected. When the wax cooled and hardened, the letter could not be opened without breaking the wax seal. The person who received the letter would see the unbroken seal and know that no one had opened it.
* A seal was put on the stone in front of Jesus’ grave in order to keep anyone from moving the stone.
