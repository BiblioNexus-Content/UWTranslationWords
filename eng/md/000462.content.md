## Isaac (id: 26734)

Isaac
=====

Facts:
------

Isaac was the only son of Abraham and Sarah. God had promised to give them a son even though they were very old.

* The name “Isaac” means “he laughs.” When God told Abraham that Sarah would give birth to a son, Abraham laughed because they were both very old. Some time later, Sarah also laughed when she heard this news.
* But God fulfilled his promise and Isaac was born to Abraham and Sarah in their old age.
* God told Abraham that the covenant he had made with Abraham would also be for Isaac and his descendants forever.
* When Isaac was a youth, God tested Abraham’s faith by commanding him to sacrifice Isaac.
* Isaac’s son Jacob had twelve sons whose descendants later became the twelve tribes of the nation of Israel.
