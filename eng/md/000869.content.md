## Temple (id: 27142)

temple, house, house of God
===========================

Facts:
------

The temple was a building surrounded by walled courtyards where the Israelites came to pray and to offer sacrifices to God. It was located on Mount Moriah in the city of Jerusalem.

* Often the term “temple” referred to the whole temple complex, including the courtyards that surrounded the main building. Sometimes it referred only to the building.
* The temple building had two rooms, the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place.
* God referred to the temple as his dwelling place.
* King Solomon built the Temple during his reign. It was supposed to be the permanent place of worship in Jerusalem.
* In the New Testament, the term “temple of the Holy Spirit” is used to refer to believers in Jesus as a group, because the Holy Spirit lives in them.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Usually when the text says that people were “in the temple,” it is referring to the courtyards outside the building. This could be translated as “in the temple courtyards” or “in the temple complex.”
* Where it refers specifically to the building itself, some translations translate “temple” as “temple building,” to make it the reference clear.
* Ways to translate “temple” could include, “God’s holy house” or “sacred worship place.”
* Often in the Bible, the temple is referred to as “the house of Yahweh” or “the house of God.”
