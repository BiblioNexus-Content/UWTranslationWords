## Fellowship Offering (id: 26596)

fellowship offering
===================

Facts:
------

In the Old Testament, the “fellowship offering” was a kind of sacrifice that was offered for different reasons, such as to give thanks to God or to fulfill a vow.

* This offering required the sacrifice of an animal that could be male or female. This was different from the burnt offering, which required a male animal.
* After giving a portion of the sacrifice to God, the person who brought the fellowship offering shared the meat with the priests and other Israelites.
* There was a meal associated with this offering which included unleavened bread.
* This is sometimes called the “peace offering.”

(See also: burnt offering, fulfill, grain offering, guilt offering, peace offering, priest, sacrifice, unleavened bread, vow)
