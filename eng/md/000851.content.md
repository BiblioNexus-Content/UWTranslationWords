## Stronghold (id: 27124)

stronghold, fortifications, fortress, citadel
=============================================

Definition:
-----------

The terms “stronghold” and “fortress” both refer to places that are well protected against an attack by enemy soldiers. A “citadel” is a fortress inside a city. The term “fortified” describes a city or other place that has been made safe from attack.

* Often, strongholds and fortresses were manmade structures with defensive walls. They could also have been places with natural protective barriers such as rocky cliffs or high mountains.
* People fortified strongholds by building thick walls or other structures that made it difficult for an enemy to break through.
* “Stronghold” or “fortress” could be translated as “securely strong place” or “strongly protected place.”
* The term “fortified city” could be translated as “securely protected city” or “strongly built city.”
* Another figurative meaning for the term “stronghold” referred to something that someone wrongly trusted in for security, such as a false god or other thing that was worshiped instead of Yahweh. This could be translated as “false strongholds.”
* This term should be translated differently from “refuge,” which emphasizes safety more than the concept of being fortified.
