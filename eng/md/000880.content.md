## The Twelve (id: 27154)

the twelve, the eleven
======================

Definition:
-----------

The term “the twelve” refers to the twelve men that Jesus chose to be his closest disciples, or apostles. After Judas killed himself, they were called “the eleven.”

* Jesus had many other disciples, but the title “the twelve” distinguished those who were apparently closest to Jesus.
* The names of these twelve disciples are listed in Matthew 10, Mark 3, and Luke 6\.
* Some time after Jesus had returned to heaven, “the eleven” chose a disciple named Matthias to take Judas’ place. Then they were called “the twelve” again.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* For many languages it may be clearer or more natural to add the noun and say, “the twelve apostles” or “Jesus’ twelve closest disciples.”
* “The eleven” could also be translated as “Jesus’ eleven remaining disciples.”
* Some translations may prefer to use a capital letter to show that it was used as a title, as in “the Twelve” and “the Eleven.”
