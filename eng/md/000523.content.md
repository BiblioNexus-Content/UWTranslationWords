## King (id: 26796)

king, kingship
==============

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, the term “king” refers to a man who is the supreme ruler of a particular group of people or a particular region of land (or both).

* In biblical times, a king was usually chosen to rule on the basis of family relation to the previous king(s). When a king died, usually his oldest son became the next king.
* The Bible often refers to God is as a king who rules over the entire universe (in a general sense) and over his people (in a specific sense).
* The New Testament refers to Jesus as a king in various ways, including: “king of the Jews;” “king of Israel;” and “king of kings.”
* Depending on the context, the term “king” might also be translated as “supreme chief” or “sovereign ruler.”
* The phrase “king of kings” might be translated as “king who rules over all other kings” or “supreme ruler who has authority over all other rulers.”
