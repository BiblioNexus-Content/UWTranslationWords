## Amen (id: 26309)

amen, truly
===========

Definition:
-----------

The term “amen” is a word used to emphasize or call attention to what a person has said. It is often used at the end of a prayer. Sometimes it is translated as “truly.”

* When used at the end of a prayer, “amen” communicates agreement with the prayer or expresses a desire that the prayer be fulfilled.
* In his teaching, Jesus used “amen” to emphasize the truth of what he said. He often followed that by “and I say to you” to introduce another teaching that related to the previous teaching.
* When Jesus uses “amen” this way, some English versions (and the ULT) translate this as “verily” or “truly.”
* Another word meaning “truly” is sometimes translated as “surely” or “certainly” and is also used to emphasize what the speaker is saying.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Consider whether the target language has a special word or phrase that is used to emphasize something that has been said.
* When used at the end of a prayer or to confirm something, “amen” could be translated as “let it be so” or “may this happen” or “that is true.”
* When Jesus says, “truly I tell you,” this could also be translated as “Yes, I tell you sincerely” or “That is true, and I also tell you.”
* The phrase “truly, truly I tell you” could be translated as “I tell you this very sincerely” or “I tell you this very earnestly” or “what I am telling you is true.”
