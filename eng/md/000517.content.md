## Justice (id: 26790)

just, justice, unjust, injustice, justify, justification
========================================================

Definition:
-----------

“Just” and “justice” refer to treating people fairly according to God’s laws. Human laws that reflect God’s standard of right behavior toward others are also just.

* To be “just” is to act in a fair and right way toward others. It also implies honesty and integrity to do what is morally right in God’s eyes.
* To act “justly” means to treat people in a way that is right, good, and proper according to God’s laws.
* To receive “justice” means to be treated fairly under the law, either being protected by the law or being punished for breaking the law.
* Sometimes the term “just” has the broader meaning of “righteous” or “following God’s laws.”

The terms “unjust” and “unjustly” refer to treating people in an unfair and often harmful manner.

* An “injustice” is something bad that is done to someone that the person did not deserve. It refers to treating people unfairly.
* Injustice also means that some people are treated badly while others are treated well.
* Someone who is acting in an unjust way is being “partial” or “prejudiced” because he is not treating people equally.

The terms “justify” and “justification” refer to causing a guilty person to be righteous. Only God can truly justify people.

* When God justifies people, he forgives their sins and makes it as though they have no sin. He justifies sinners who repent and trust in Jesus to save them from their sins.
* “Justification” refers to what God does when he forgives a person’s sins and declares that person to be righteous in his sight.
