------

The “people of Ammon” or the “Ammonites” were a people group that lived on the east side of the Jordan River across from the Israelites.

* The book of Genesis reports that the Ammonite nation was descended from Ben\-ammi, who was the son of Lot by his younger daughter.
* The term “Ammonitess” refers specifically to a female Ammonite. This could also be translated as “Ammonite woman.”
* At one point, the Ammonites hired a prophet named Balaam to curse Israel, but God did not allow him to do it.
