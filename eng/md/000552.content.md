## Levite (id: 26825)

Levi, Levite
============

Definition:
-----------

Levi was Jacob’s third son. He was Leah’s third son. His descendants became one of the tribes of Israel.

* The tribe descended from him was known as the “tribe of Levi” or the “Levites.”
* The name Levi is similar to the Hebrew word for “join to.”
* Unlike the other tribes, the tribe of Levi did not inherit a unified area of land in Canaan. Instead, they inherited various cities scattered throughout the regions belonging to the other tribes.
* The tribe of Levi was responsible for taking care of the tabernacle (and later, the temple) and conducting religious rituals, including offering sacrifices and prayers for the Israelite people.
* In the Old Testament, it is not always clear whether the term “Levite” refers generally to a descendant of Levi or specifically to a person who served in the temple helping the priests.
* The Old Testament law prescribed that all priests were to be chosen from the tribe of Levi. The Levite priests were set apart and dedicated for the special work of serving God in the temple.
* Two other men named “Levi” were ancestors of Jesus. Their names are listed in the genealogy in the gospel of Luke.
* Jesus’ disciple Matthew was also called Levi.
