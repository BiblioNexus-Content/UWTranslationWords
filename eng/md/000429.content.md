## Holy Place (id: 26701)

holy place
==========

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, the terms “the holy place” and “the most holy place” refer to the two parts of the tabernacle or temple building.

* The “holy place” was the first room, and it contained the altar of incense and the table with the special “bread of the presence” on it.
* The “most holy place” was the second, innermost room, and it contained the ark of the covenant.
* A thick, heavy curtain separated the outer room from the inner room.
* The high priest was the only one who was permitted to go into the most holy place.
* Sometimes “holy place” refers to both the building and courtyard areas of either the temple or tabernacle. It could also refer generally to any place that is set apart for God.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The term “holy place” could also be translated as “room set apart for God” or “special room for meeting God” or “place reserved for God.”
* The term “most holy place” could be translated as “room that is the most set apart for God” or “most special room for meeting God.”
* Depending on the context, ways to translate the general expression “a holy place” could include “a consecrated place” or “a place that God has set apart” or “a place in the temple complex, which is holy” or “a courtyard of God’s holy temple.”
