Phoenicia, Syrophoenician
=========================

Facts:
------

In ancient times, Phoenicia was a wealthy nation located in Canaan along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, north of Israel.

* Phoenicia occupied an area of land that was in the western region of what is the present\-day country of Lebanon.
* In New Testament times, the capital of Phoenicia was Tyre. Another important Phoenician city was Sidon. Phoenicia was near Syria, so people from that area were called “Syrophoenician.”
* Phoenicians were well\-known for their woodworking skills using their country’s plentiful cedar trees, for their production of a costly purple dye, and for their ability to travel and trade by sea. They were also highly skilled boat builders.
* One of the earliest alphabets was created by the Phoenician people. Their alphabet was widely used because of their contact with many people groups through trading.
