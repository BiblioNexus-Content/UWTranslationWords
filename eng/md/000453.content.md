## Inherit (id: 26725)

inherit, inheritance, heir
==========================

Definition:
-----------

The term “inherit” refers to receiving something valuable from a parent after a parent dies. The term can also refer to receiving something valuable from some other person because of a special relationship with that person. An “inheritance” is the things that are received, and an “heir” is a person who receives an inheritance.

* A physical inheritance that is received may be money, land, or other kinds of property.
* God promised Abraham and his descendants that they would inherit the land of Canaan, that it would belong to them forever.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* As always, consider first whether there are already terms in the target language for the concept of an heir or an inheritance, and use those terms.
* Depending on the context, other ways that the term “inherit” could be translated might include “receive” or “possess” or “come into possession of.”
* Ways to translate “inheritance” could include “promised gift” or “secure possession.”
* The term “heir” could be translated with a word or phrase that means “privileged child who receives the father’s possessions.”
* The term “heritage” could be translated as “inherited blessings.”
