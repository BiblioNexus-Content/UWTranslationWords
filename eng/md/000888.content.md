time, untimely, date
====================

Facts:
------

In the Bible the term “time” was often used figuratively to refer to a specific season or period of time when certain events took place. It has a meaning similar to “age” or “epoch” or “season.”

* “Time” can mean “occasion” in a phrase like “third time.” The phrase “many times” can mean “on many occasions.”
* Depending on the context, the term “time” could be translated as, “season” or “time period” or “moment” or “event” or “occurrence.”
* The phrase “times and seasons” is a figurative expression which states the same idea twice. This could also be translated as “certain events happening in certain time periods.” (See: doublet)

(See also: age, tribulation)
