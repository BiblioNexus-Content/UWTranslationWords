The terms “possess” and “possession” usually refer to owning something. They can also mean to gain control over something or occupy an area of land.

* In the Old Testament, this term is often used in the context of “possessing” or “taking possession of” an area of land.
* When Yahweh commanded the Israelites to “possess” the land of Canaan, it meant that they should go into the land and live there. This involved first conquering the Canaanite peoples who were living on that land.

* The people of Israel were also called Yahweh’s “special possession.” This means that they belonged to him as his people whom he had specifically called to worship and serve him.
