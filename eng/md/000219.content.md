Cush
====

Facts:
------

Cush was the oldest son of Noah’s son Ham. He was also the ancestor of Nimrod. Two of his brothers were named Egypt and Canaan.

* In Old Testament times, “Cush” was the name of a large region of land south of Israel. It is probable that the land was named after Ham’s son Cush.
* The ancient region of Cush covered an area of land that may have, at different times, included parts of the modern\-day countries of Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia, and possibly, Saudi Arabia.
* Another man named Cush is mentioned in the Psalms. He was a Benjamite.
