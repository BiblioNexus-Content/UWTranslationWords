Definition:
-----------

The olive is the small, oval fruit from an olive tree, which is mostly grown in the regions surrounding the Mediterranean Sea.

* Olive trees are a type of large evergreen shrub with tiny white flowers. They grow best in hot weather and can survive well with little water.
* The olive tree’s fruit starts out green and changes to black as they ripen. Olives were useful for food and for the oil that could be extracted from them.
* Olive oil was used for cooking in lamps and for religious ceremonies.
* In the Bible, olive trees and branches are sometimes used figuratively to refer to people.
