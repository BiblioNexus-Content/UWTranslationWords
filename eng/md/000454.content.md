## Iniquity (id: 26726)

iniquity
========

Definition:
-----------

The term “iniquity” is a word that is very similar in meaning to the term “sin,” but may more specifically refer to conscious acts of wrongdoing or great wickedness.

* The word “iniquity” literally means a twisting or distorting (of the law). It refers to major injustice.
* Iniquity could be described as deliberate, harmful actions against other people.
* Other definitions of iniquity include “perversity” and “depravity,” which are both words that describe conditions of terrible sin.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The term “iniquity” could be translated as “wickedness” or “perverse actions” or “harmful acts.”
* Often, “iniquity” occurs in the same text as the word “sin” and “transgression” so it is important to have different ways of translating these terms.

(See also: sin, transgress, trespass)
