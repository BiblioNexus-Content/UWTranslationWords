partial, partiality
===================

Definition:
-----------

The terms “be partial” and “show partiality” refer to making a choice to treat certain people as more important than other people.

* This is similar to showing favoritism, which means to treat some people better than others.
* Usually partiality or favoritism is shown to people because they are more rich or more popular than other people.
* The Bible instructs his people to not show partiality or favoritism to people who are rich or of high status.
* In his letter to the Romans, Paul teaches that God judges people fairly and with no partiality.
* The book of James teaches that it is wrong to give someone a better seat or better treatment because they are rich.
