Facts:
------

The term “tent of meeting” refers to a tent which was a temporary place where God met with Moses before the tabernacle was built.

* The tent of meeting was set up outside the camp of the Israelites.
* When Moses went into the tent of meeting to meet with God, a pillar of cloud would stand at the entrance to the tent as a sign of God’s presence there.
* After the Israelites built the tabernacle, the temporary tent was no longer needed and the term “tent of meeting” was sometimes used to refer to the tabernacle.
