Definition:
-----------

The terms “defile” and “be defiled” refer to becoming polluted or dirty. Something can be defiled in a physical, moral, or ritual sense.

* God warned the Israelites to not defile themselves by eating or touching things that he had declared as “unclean” and “unholy.”
* Certain things such as dead bodies and contagious diseases were declared by God to be unclean and would defile a person if they touched them.
* God commanded the Israelites to avoid sexual sins. These would defile them and make them unacceptable to God.
* There were also certain kinds of bodily processes that defiled a person temporarily until he could become ritually pure again.
* In the New Testament, Jesus taught that sinful thoughts and actions are what truly defile a person.
