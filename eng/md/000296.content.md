## Esau (id: 26568)

Esau
====

Facts:
------

Esau was one of the twin sons of Isaac and Rebekah. He was the first baby born to them. His twin brother was Jacob.

* Esau sold his birthright to his brother Jacob in exchange for a bowl of food.
* Since Esau was born first, his father Isaac was supposed to give him a special blessing. But Jacob tricked Isaac into giving him that blessing instead. At first Esau was so angry that he wanted to kill Jacob, but later he forgave him.
* Esau had many children and grandchildren, and these descendants formed a large people group living in the land of Canaan.
