## Siege (id: 27091)

siege, besiege, besieged, siegeworks
====================================

Definition:
-----------

A “siege” occurs when an attacking army surrounds a city and keeps it from receiving any supplies of food and water. To “besiege” a city or to put it “under siege” means to attack it by means of a siege.

* When the Babylonians came to attack Israel, they used the tactic of a siege against Jerusalem to weaken the people inside the city.
* Often during a siege, ramps of dirt are gradually constructed to enable the attacking army to cross over the city walls and invade the city.
* To “besiege” a city can also be expressed as to “lay siege” to it or to “perform a siege” on it.
* The term “besieged” has the same meaning as the expression “under siege.” Both these expressions describe a city that an enemy army is surrounding and besieging.
