## Thorn (id: 27157)

thorn, thorn bush, thistle
==========================

Facts:
------

Thorn bushes and thistles are plants that have prickly branches or flowers. These plants do not produce fruit or anything else that is useful.

* A “thorn” is a hard, sharp growth on the branch or stem of a plant. A “thornbush” is a type of small tree or shrub that has many thorns on its branches.
* A “thistle” is a plant with prickly stems and leaves. Often the flowers are purple.
* Thorn and thistle plants multiply quickly and can cause nearby plants or crops to not be able to grow. This is a picture of how sin keeps a person from producing good spiritual fruit.
* A crown made of twisted thorn branches was placed on Jesus’ head before he was crucified.
* If possible, these terms should be translated by the names of two different plants or bushes that are known in the language area.
