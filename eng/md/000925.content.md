* Usually the term “warrior” is a general, broad term to refer to a man who is gifted and courageous in battle.
* Yahweh is figuratively described as a “warrior.”
* The term “soldier” more specifically refers to someone who belongs to a certain army or who is fighting in a certain battle.
* Roman soldiers in Jerusalem were there to keep order and to carry out duties such as executing prisoners. They guarded Jesus before crucifying him and some were ordered to stand guard at his tomb.
