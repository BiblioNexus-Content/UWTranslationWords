## World (id: 27214)

world, worldly
==============

Definition:
-----------

The term “world” usually refers to the part of the universe where people live: the earth. The term “worldly” describes the evil values and behaviors of people living in this world.

* In its most general sense, the term “world” refers to the heavens and the earth, as well as everything in them.
* In many contexts, “world” actually means “people in the world.”
* Sometimes it is implied that this refers to the evil people on earth or the people who do not obey God.
* The apostles also used “world” to refer to the selfish behaviors and corrupt values of the people living in this world. This can include self\-righteous religious practices which are based on human efforts.
* People and things characterized by these values are said to be “worldly.”

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Depending on the context, “world” could also be translated as “universe” or “people of this world” or “corrupt things in the world” or “evil attitudes of people in the world.”
* The phrase “all the world” often means “many people” and refers to the people living in a certain region. For example, “all the world came to Egypt” could be translated as “many people from the surrounding countries came to Egypt” or “people from all the countries surrounding Egypt came there.”
* Another way to translate “all the world went to their hometown to be registered in the Roman census” would be “many of the people living in regions ruled by the Roman empire went…”
* Depending on the context, the term “worldly” could be translated as “evil” or “sinful” or “selfish” or “ungodly” or “corrupt” or “influenced by the corrupt values of people in this world.”
* The phrase “saying these things in the world” can be translated as “saying these things to the people of the world.”
* In other contexts, “in the world” could also be translated as “living among the people of the world” or “living among ungodly people.”
