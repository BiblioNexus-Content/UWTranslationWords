## Troas (id: 27177)

Troas
=====

Facts:
------

The city of Troas was a seaport located on the northwest coast of the ancient Roman province of Asia.

* Paul visited Troas at least three times during his trips to different regions to preach the gospel.
* On one occasion in Troas, Paul preached long into the night and a young man named Eutychus fell asleep while he was listening. Because he had been sitting in an open window, Eutychus fell down a long way and died. Through God’s power, Paul raised this young man back to life.
* When Paul was in Rome, he asked Timothy to bring him his scrolls and his cloak, which he had left behind in Troas.
