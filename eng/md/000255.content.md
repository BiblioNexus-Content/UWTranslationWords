disciple
========

Definition:
-----------

The term “disciple” refers to a person who spends much time with a teacher, learning from that teacher’s character and teaching.

* The people who followed Jesus around, listening to his teachings and obeying them, were called his “disciples.”
* John the Baptist also had disciples.
* During Jesus’ ministry, there were many disciples who followed him and heard his teachings.
* Jesus chose twelve disciples to be his closest followers; these men became known as his “apostles.”
* Jesus’ twelve apostles continued to be known as his “disciples” or “the 12\.”
* Just before Jesus went up to heaven, he commanded his disciples to teach other people about how to become Jesus’ disciples, too.
* Anyone who believes in Jesus and obeys his teachings is called a disciple of Jesus.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The term “disciple” could be translated by a word or phrase that means “follower” or “student” or “pupil” or “learner.”
* Make sure that the translation of this term does not refer only to a student who learns in a classroom.
* The translation of this term should also be different from the translation of “apostle.”
