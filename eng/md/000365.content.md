## Gibeon (id: 26637)

Gibeon, Gibeonite
=================

Facts:
------

Gibeon was a city that was located about 13 kilometers northwest of Jerusalem. The people living in Gibeon were the Gibeonites.

* When the Gibeonites heard about how the Israelites had destroyed the cities of Jericho and Ai, they were afraid.
* So the Gibeonites came to the leaders of Israel at Gilgal and pretended to be people from a far\-away country.
* The Israelite leaders were deceived and made an agreement with the Gibeonites that they would protect them and not destroy them.
