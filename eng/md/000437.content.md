========

Definition:
-----------

In Bible times, the term “horsemen” referred to men who rode horses into battle.

* Warriors who rode in horse\-pulled chariots may also have been called “horsemen,” though this term usually refers to men who were actually riding on horses.
* Yahweh commanded the Israelites not to have many horsemen because having a strong army would cause them to trust their own strength rather than Yahweh in battle.
* This term could also be translated as “horse riders” or “men on horses.”

(See also: chariot, horse)
