The term “deceive” means to cause someone to believe something that is not true, often by telling a “lie.” The act of deceiving someone is called “lying,” “deceit,” or “deception.”

* Someone who causes others to believe something false is a “deceiver.” For example, Satan is called a “deceiver.” The evil spirits that he controls are also deceivers.
* To “lie” is to say something that is not true.

* The terms “deceit” and “deception” have the same meaning, but there are some small differences in how they are used.
* The descriptive terms “deceitful” and “deceptive” have the same meaning and are used in the same contexts.
