## Goat (id: 26645)

goat, goatskins, scapegoat, kids
================================

Definition:
-----------

A goat is a medium\-sized, four\-legged animal which is similar to a sheep and is raised primarily for its milk and meat. A baby goat is called a “kid.”

* Like sheep, goats were important animals of sacrifice, especially at Passover.
* Although goats and sheep can be very similar, these are some ways that they are different:

    + Goats have coarse hair; sheep have wool.
        + The tail of a goat stands up; the tail of a sheep hangs down.
        + Sheep usually like to stay with their herd, but goats are more independent and tend to wander away from their herd.
* In Bible times, goats were often the main source of milk in Israel.
* Goat skins were used for tent coverings and to make bags for holding wine.
* In both the Old and New Testaments, the goat was used as a symbol for unrighteous people, perhaps because of its tendency to wander away from the one taking care of it.
* The Israelites also used goats as symbolic sin bearers. When one goat was sacrificed, the priest would lay his hands on a second, live goat, and send it into the desert as a symbol that the animal was bearing the people’s sins.
