-----------

To “preach” means to speak to a group of people, teaching them about God and urging them to obey him. To “proclaim” means to announce or declare something publicly and boldly.

* Often preaching is done by one person to a large group of people. It is usually spoken, not written.
* “Preaching” and “teaching” are similar, but are not exactly the same.
* “Preaching” mainly refers to publicly proclaiming spiritual or moral truth, and urging the audience to respond. “Teaching” is a term that emphasizes instruction, that is, giving people information or teaching them how to do something.
* The term “preach” is usually used with the word “gospel.”
* What a person has preached to others can also be referred to in general as his “teachings.”
* Often in the Bible, “proclaim” means to announce publicly something that God has commanded, or to tell others about God and how great he is.
* In the New Testament, the apostles proclaimed the good news about Jesus to many people in many different cities and regions.
* The term “proclaim” can also be used for decrees made by kings or for denouncing evil in a public way.
* Other ways to translate “proclaim” could include “announce” or “openly preach” or “publicly declare.”
* The term “proclamation” could also be translated as “announcement” or “public preaching.”
