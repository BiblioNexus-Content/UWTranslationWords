The term “innocent” means to not be guilty of a crime or other wrongdoing. It can also refer more generally to people who are not involved in evil things.

* Sometimes the term “innocent” is used to refer to people who have done nothing wrong to deserve the bad treatment they are receiving, as in an enemy army attacking “innocent people.”
* In the Bible, “blood” can represent “killing,” so “innocent blood” refers to “killing people who did not deserve to die.”
