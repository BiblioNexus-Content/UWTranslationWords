=====================

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, the term “mystery” refers to something that we cannot know or understand unless God reveals it or explains it to us.

* The New Testament states that the gospel of Christ was a mystery that was not known in past ages.
* One of the specific points described as a mystery is that Jews and Gentiles would be equal in Christ.
* This term could also be translated as “secret” or “hidden truth” or “previously unknown thing.”
