## Antioch (id: 26322)

Antioch
=======

Facts:
------

Antioch was the name of two cities in the New Testament. One was in Syria, near the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The other was in the Roman province of Pisidia, near the city of Colossae.

* The local church at Antioch of Syria was the first place where believers in Jesus were called “Christians.” The church there was also active in sending out missionaries to reach the Gentiles.
* The leaders of the church in Jerusalem sent a letter to the believers in the church at Antioch in Syria to help them know they didn’t have to keep the Jewish laws in order to be Christians.
* Paul, Barnabas and John Mark traveled to the Antioch in Pisidia to share the gospel. Some Jews from other cities came there to stir up trouble, and they tried to kill Paul. But many other people, both Jews and Gentiles, listened to the teaching and believed in Jesus.
