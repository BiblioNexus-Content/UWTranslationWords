## Snare (id: 27104)

snare, ensnare, entrap, trap, trapped, pitfall
==============================================

Definition:
-----------

The terms “snare” and “trap” refer to devices that are used to catch animals and keep them from escaping. To “snare” or “ensnare” is to catch with a snare, and to “trap” or “entrap” is to catch with a trap. In the Bible, these terms were also used figuratively to talk about how sin and temptation are like hidden traps that catch people and harm them.

* A “snare” is a loop of rope or wire that suddenly pulls tight when an animal steps into it, ensnaring its leg.
* A “trap” is usually made of metal or wood and has two parts that suddenly and powerfully close together, catching an animal so it can’t get away. Sometimes a trap can be a deep hole that has been made in order to get something to fall into it.
* Usually the snare or trap is hidden so that its prey is taken by surprise.
* The phrase “set a trap” means to get a trap ready to capture something.
* To “fall into a trap” refers to falling into a deep hole or pit that was dug and hidden in order to catch an animal.
* A person who is starts sinning and cannot stop can be described as “ensnared by sin” in a figurative reference to the way an animal can be ensnared and cannot escape.
* Just as an animal is endangered and hurt by being in a trap, so a person caught in the trap of sin is being harmed by that sin and needs to be set free.
