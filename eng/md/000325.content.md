## Festival (id: 26597)

festival, feast, celebrate
==========================

Definition:
-----------

In general, a festival is a celebration held by a community of people.

* The word for “festival” in the Old Testament literally means “appointed time.”
* The festivals celebrated by the Israelites were specially appointed times or seasons that God had commanded them to observe.
* In some English translations, the word “feast” is used instead of festival because the celebrations included having a large meal together.
* There were several main festivals that the Israelites celebrated every year:

    + Passover
        + Festival of Unleavened Bread
        + Firstfruits
        + Festival of Weeks (Pentecost)
        + Festival of Trumpets
        + Day of Atonement
        + Festival of Shelters
* The purpose of these festivals was to thank God and to remember the amazing things he had done to rescue, protect, and provide for his people.
