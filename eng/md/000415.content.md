## Hell (id: 26687)

hell, lake of fire
==================

Definition:
-----------

Hell is the final place of unending pain and suffering where God will punish everyone who rebels against him and rejects his plan of saving them through Jesus’ sacrifice. It is also referred to as the “lake of fire.”

* Hell is described as a place of fire and severe suffering.
* Satan and the evil spirits who follow him will be thrown into hell for eternal punishment.
* People who do not believe in Jesus’ sacrifice for their sin and do not trust in him to save them, will be punished forever in hell.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* These terms should probably be translated differently since they occur in different contexts.
* Some languages cannot use “lake” in the phrase “lake of fire” because it refers to water.
* The term “hell” could be translated as “place of suffering” or “final place of darkness and pain.”
* The term “lake of fire” could also be translated as “sea of fire” or “huge fire (of suffering)” or “field of fire.”
