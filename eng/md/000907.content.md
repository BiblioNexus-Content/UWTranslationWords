trust, trusted, trustworthy, trustworthiness
============================================

Definition:
-----------

To “trust” something or someone is to believe that the thing or person is true or dependable. That belief is also called “trust.” A “trustworthy” person is one you can trust to do and say what is right and true, and therefore one who has the quality of “trustworthiness.”

* Trust is closely related to faith. If we trust someone, we have faith in that person to do what they promised to do.
* Having trust in someone also means depending on that person.
* To “trust in” Jesus means to believe that he is God, to believe that he died on the cross to pay for our sins, and to rely on him to save us.
* A “trustworthy saying” refers to something that is said that can be counted on to be true.
