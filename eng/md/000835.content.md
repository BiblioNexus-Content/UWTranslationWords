## Son of God (id: 27108)

Son of God, the Son
===================

Facts:
------

The term “Son of God” refers to Jesus, the Word of God, who came into the world as a human being. He is also often referred to as “the Son.”

* The Son of God has the same nature as God the Father, and is fully God.
* God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are all of one essence.
* Unlike human sons, the Son of God has always existed.
* In the beginning, the Son of God was active in creating the world, along with the Father and the Holy Spirit.

Because Jesus is God’s Son, he loves and obeys his Father, and his Father loves him.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* For the term “Son of God,” it is best to translate “Son” with the same word the language would naturally use to refer to a human son.
* Make sure the word used to translate “son” fits with the word used to translate “father” and that these words are the most natural ones used to express a true father\-son relationship in the project language.
* Using a capital letter to begin “Son” may help show that this is talking about God.
* The phrase “the Son” is a shortened form of “the Son of God,” especially when it occurs in the same context as “the Father.”
