======================================

Facts:
------

The terms “interpret” and “interpretation” refer to understanding and explaining the meaning of something that is not clear.

* Often in the Bible these terms are used in connection with explaining the meaning of dreams or visions.
* When the king of Babylon had some confusing dreams, God helped Daniel to interpret them and to explain their meanings.
* The “interpretation” of the dream is the “explanation” of the meaning of the dream.
* In the Old Testament, God sometimes used dreams to reveal to people what would happen in the future. So the interpretations of those dreams were prophecies.
* The term “interpret” can also refer to figuring out the meaning of other things, such as figuring out what the weather will be like based on how cold or hot it is, how windy it is, and what the sky looks like.
* Ways to translate the term “interpret” could include, “figure out the meaning of” or “explain” or “give the meaning of.”
* The term “interpretation” could also be translated as “explanation” or “meaning.”
