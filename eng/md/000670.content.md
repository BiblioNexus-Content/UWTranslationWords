## Perfect (id: 26944)

perfect, complete
=================

Definition:
-----------

In the New Testament, the term “perfect” means to be mature in our Christian life. To perfect something means to work at it until it is excellent and without flaws. Old Testament sacrifices needed to be “perfect” or “complete,” that is, without blemish.

* Being perfect and mature means that a Christian is obedient, not sinless.
* The term “perfect” also has the meaning of being “complete” or “whole.”
* The New Testament book of James states that persevering through trials will produce completeness and maturity in the believer.
* When Christians study the Bible and obey it, they will become more spiritually perfect and mature because they will be more like Christ in their character.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* This term could be translated as “without flaw” or “without error” or “flawless” or “without fault” or “not having any faults.”
