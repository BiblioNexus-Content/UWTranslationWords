## Sinai (id: 27099)

Sinai, Horeb
============

Facts:
------

Mount Sinai, also called Mount Horeb, is a mountain that was probably located in the southern part of what is now called the Sinai Peninsula, but the exact location of this mountain is not known.

* It is the place where God revealed his covenant to the Israelites and gave Moses the stone tablets on which he had written the ten commandments.
* It is also called the “mountain of God.”
* It was also the place where God later told Moses to strike a rock to provide water for the Israelites as they were wandering in the desert.
* It was the place where Moses saw the burning bush when he was tending sheep.
* It is possible that “Horeb” was the actual name of the mountain and that “Mount Sinai” simply means “mountain of Sinai,” referring to the fact that Mount Horeb was located in the desert of Sinai.
