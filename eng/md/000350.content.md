------

Gad was Jacob’s seventh son. He was Zilpah’s first son. His descendants became one of the tribes of Israel.

* The tribe descended from him was known as the “tribe of Gad” or “Gad” or “Gad.”
* The name Gad is similar to the Hebrew word for “good fortune.”
* The tribe of Gad settled on the eastern side of the Jordan River between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea. This was to the north of Reuben and south of half of the tribe of Manasseh. When used as the name of a region of land, the term “Gad” refers to the land given to the tribe of Gad.
* Another man in the Bible named Gad was a prophet who confronted King David for his sin of taking a census of the Israelite people.
