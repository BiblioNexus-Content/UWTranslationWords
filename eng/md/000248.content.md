==================

Definition:
-----------

A desert, or wilderness, is a dry, barren place where very few plants and trees can grow.

* A desert is a land area with a dry climate and few plants or animals.
* Because of the harsh conditions, very few people can live in the desert, so it is also referred to as “wilderness.”
* “Wilderness” conveys the meaning of being remote, desolate and isolated from people.
* This word can also be translated as “deserted place” or “remote place” or “uninhabited place.”
