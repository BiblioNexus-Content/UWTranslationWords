Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* When referring to a place of worship, this term could be translated as “a house for worshiping God” or “a place for worshiping God.”
* If it is referring to the temple or tabernacle, this could be translated as “the temple (or tabernacle) where God is worshiped” (or “where God is present” or “where God meets with his people”).
* The word “house” may be important to use in the translation in order to communicate that God “dwells” there, that is, his spirit is in that place to meet with his people and to be worshiped by them.
* The phrase “house of Yahweh” could be translated as “Yahweh’s temple” or “place where Yahweh is worshiped” or “place where Yahweh meets with his people” or “where Yahweh dwells.” The phrase “house of God” could be translated in a similar way.
