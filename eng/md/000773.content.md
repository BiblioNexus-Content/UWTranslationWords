## Sacrifice (id: 27046)

sacrifice, sacrifices, offering
===============================

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, the terms “sacrifice” and “offering” refer to special gifts given to God as an act of worshiping him. People also offered sacrifices to false gods.

### sacrifice

* Sacrifices to God often involved the killing of an animal.
* Only the sacrifice of Jesus, God’s perfect sinless Son, can completely cleanse people from sin; animal sacrifices could never do that.

### offering

* The word “offering” generally refers to anything that is offered or given. The term “sacrifice” refers to something that is given or done at great cost to the giver.
* Offerings to God were specific things that he commanded the Israelites to give in order to express devotion and obedience to him.
* The names of the different offerings, such as “burnt offering” and “peace offering,” indicated what kind of offering was being given.

Translation Suggestions
-----------------------

* The term “offering” could also be translated as “a gift to God” or “something given to God” or “something valuable that is presented to God.”
* Depending on the context, the term “sacrifice” could also be translated as “something valuable given in worship” or “a special animal killed and presented to God.”
* The action to “sacrifice” could be translated as to “give up something valuable” or to “kill an animal and give it to God.”
* Another way to translate “present yourself as a living sacrifice” could be “as you live your life, offer yourself to God as completely as an animal is offered on an altar.”
