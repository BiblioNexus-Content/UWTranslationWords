## Tempt (id: 27143)

tempt, temptation
=================

Definition:
-----------

To tempt someone is to try to get that person to do something wrong.

* A temptation is something that causes a person to want to do something wrong.
* People are tempted by their own sinful nature and by other people.
* Satan also tempts people to disobey God and to sin against God by doing wrong things.
* Satan tempted Jesus and tried to get him to do something wrong, but Jesus resisted all of Satan’s temptations and never sinned.
* Someone who is “tempting God” is not trying to get him to do something wrong, but rather, is continuing in stubborn disobedience of him to the point that God must respond by punishing him. This is also called “testing God.”

Translation Suggestions:
