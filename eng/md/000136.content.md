## Born Again (id: 26409)

born again, born of God, new birth
==================================

Definition:
-----------

The term “born again” was first used by Jesus to describe what it means for God to change a person from being dead spiritually to being alive spiritually. The terms “born of God” and “born of the Spirit” also refer to a person being given new spiritual life.

* All humans are born spiritually dead and are given a “new birth” when they accept Jesus Christ as their Savior.
* At the moment of the spiritual new birth, God’s Holy Spirit begins to live in the new believer and empowers him to produce good spiritual fruit in his life.
* It is God’s work to cause a person to be born again and become his child.
