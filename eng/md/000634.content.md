* Nehemiah led the Israelites in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem which had been destroyed by the Babylonians.
* For twelve years Nehemiah was the governor of Jerusalem before returning to the king’s palace.
* The Old Testament book of Nehemiah tells the story of Nehemiah’s work in rebuilding the walls and his governing of the people in Jerusalem.
