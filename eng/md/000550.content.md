-----------

The term “leprosy” is used in the Bible to refer to several different skin diseases. A “leper” is a person who has leprosy. The term “leprous” describes a person or body part that is infected with leprosy.

* Certain kinds of leprosy cause the skin to become discolored with white patches, as when Miriam and Naaman had leprosy.
* In modern times, leprosy often causes hands, feet, and other body parts to become damaged and deformed.
* According to the instructions that God gave to the Israelites, when a person had leprosy, he was considered “unclean” and had to stay away from other people so that they would not become infected with the disease.
* A leper would often call out “unclean” so that others would be warned not to come near him.
* Jesus healed many lepers, and also people who had other kinds of diseases.
