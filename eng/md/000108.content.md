## Believe (id: 26381)

believe, believer, belief, unbeliever, unbelief
===============================================

Definition:
-----------

The terms “believe” and “believe in” are closely related, but have slightly different meanings:

### 1\. believe

* To believe something is to accept or trust that it is true.
* To believe someone is to acknowledge that what that person has said is true.

### 2\. believe in

* To “believe in” someone means to “trust in” that person. It means to trust that the person is who he says he is, that he always speaks the truth, and that he will do what he has promised to do.
* When a person truly believes in something, he will act in such a way that shows that belief.
* The phrase “have faith in” usually has the same meaning as “believe in.”
* To “believe in Jesus” means to believe that he is the Son of God, that he is God himself who also became human and who died as a sacrifice to pay for our sins. It means to trust him as Savior and live in a way that honors him.

### 3\. believer

In the Bible, the term “believer” refers to someone who believes in and relies on Jesus Christ as Savior.

* The term “believer” literally means “person who believes.”
* The term “Christian” eventually came to be the main title for believers because it indicates that they believe in Christ and obey his teachings.

### 4\. unbelief

The term “unbelief” refers to not believing something or someone.

* In the Bible, “unbelief” refers to not believing in or not trusting in Jesus as one’s Savior.
* A person who does not believe in Jesus is called an “unbeliever.”

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* To “believe” could be translated as to “know to be true” or “know to be right.”
* To “believe in” could be translated as “trust completely” or “trust and obey” or “completely rely on and follow.”
* Some translations may prefer to say “believer in Jesus” or “believer in Christ.”
* This term could also be translated by a word or phrase that means “person who trusts in Jesus” or “someone who knows Jesus and lives for him.”
* Other ways to translate “believer” could be “follower of Jesus” or “person who knows and obeys Jesus.”
* The term “believer” is a general term for any believer in Christ, while “disciple” and “apostle” were used more specifically for people who knew Jesus while he was alive. It is best to translate these terms in different ways, in order to keep them distinct.
* Other ways to translate “unbelief” could include “lack of faith” or “not believing.”
* The term “unbeliever” could be translated as “person who does not believe in Jesus” or “someone who does not trust in Jesus as Savior.”
