## Hebron (id: 26685)

Hebron, Kiriath Arba
====================

Facts:
------

Hebron was a city located in the high, rocky hills about 20 miles south of Jerusalem.

* The city was built around 2000 BC during the time of Abram. It was mentioned many times in the historical accounts given in the Old Testament.
* Hebron had a very important role in King David’s life. Several of his sons, including Absalom, were born there.
* The city was destroyed around AD 70 by the Romans.
* The city of Hebron was formerly called Kiriath Arba (see Joshua 14:15 and Joshua 15:54\).
* The city of Hebron, formerly called Kiriath Arba, was probably founded by Arba, the father of Anak and may have been originally named Kiriath Arba to honor Arba because Joshua 14:15 records that Arba “was a great man among the Anakites.”
* The name “Hebron” is an English transliteration of the Hebrew word for Hebron.
