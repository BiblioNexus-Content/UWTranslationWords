## Elder (id: 26551)

elder, older, old
=================

Definition:
-----------

The term “elder” or “older” refers to people (in the Bible, usually men) who have grown old enough to become mature adults and leaders within a community. For example, elders might have gray hair, have adult children, or perhaps even have grandchildren or great\-grandchildren.

* The term “elder” came from the fact that elders were originally older men who, because of their age and experience, had greater wisdom.
* In the Old Testament, the elders helped lead the Israelites in matters of justice and the Law of Moses.
* In the New Testament, Jewish “elders” continued to be leaders in their communities and also were judges for the people.
* In the early Christian churches, Christian “elders” gave spiritual leadership to the local assemblies of believers. Elders in these churches sometimes included young men who were spiritually mature.
* This term could be translated as “older men” or “spiritually mature men leading the church.”
