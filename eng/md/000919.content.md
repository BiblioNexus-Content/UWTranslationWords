## Veil (id: 27192)

veil, veiled, unveiled
======================

Definition:
-----------

The term “veil” usually refers to a thin piece of cloth that is used as a head covering, to fully or partially cover the head or face.

* Moses covered his face with a veil after he had been in the presence of Yahweh, so that the brightness of his face would be hidden from the people.
* In the Bible, women wore a veil to cover their head, and often their face as well, when they were in public or in the presence of men.
* The veils that women in the Bible wore over their face may have been made of thin material which could be partly seen through and may have only covered part of the face so that the women's eyes were not covered.
* The verb to “veil” means to cover something with a veil.
* In some English versions, the word “veil” is used to refer to the thick curtain that covered the entrance into the most holy place. But “curtain” is a better term in that context, since it refers to a heavy, thick piece of cloth.

Translation Suggestions
-----------------------

* The term “veil” could also be translated as “thin cloth covering” or “cloth covering” or “head covering” or “head covering.”
* In some cultures, there may already be a term for a veil for women. It may be necessary to find a different word when it is used for Moses.
