## Nazareth (id: 26903)

Nazareth, Nazarene
==================

Facts:
------

Nazareth is a town in the region of Galilee in northern Israel. It is about 100 kilometers north of Jerusalem, and it takes about three to five days to travel there on foot.

* Joseph and Mary were from Nazareth, and this is where they raised Jesus. That is why Jesus was known as “the Nazarene.”
* Many of the Jews living in Nazareth did not respect Jesus’ teaching because he had grown up among them, and they thought he was just an ordinary person.
* Once, when Jesus was teaching in Nazareths synagogue, the Jews there tried to kill him because he claimed to be the Messiah and had rebuked them for rejecting him.
* The remark Nathaniel made when he heard that Jesus was from Nazareth indicated that this city was not thought of very highly.
