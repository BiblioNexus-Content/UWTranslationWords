## Jacob (id: 26739)

Jacob, Israel
=============

Facts:
------

Jacob was the younger twin son of Isaac by Rebekah. God changed his name to “Israel.” His descendants became the nation of Israel.

* Jacob is the last of the three patriarchs of the Israelite nation: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The descendants of Jacob’s twelve sons because the twelve tribes of Israel.
* The name Jacob is similar to the Hebrew word meaning “heel.” As Jacob was being born, he was holding onto the heel of his twin brother Esau. In the Old Testament times, the heel was a body part associated both with attack and with the rear part of a person’s body. The Hebrew name Jacob was probably associated with the idea of attacking someone from behind.
* Many years later, God changed Jacob’s name to “Israel,” which probably means “He struggles with God.”
* Jacob married Laban’s two daughters, Leah and Rachel, as well as each of their servants, Zilpah and Bilhah. These four women mothered the twelve sons who became the ancestral fathers of the twelve tribes of Israel.
* In the New Testament, a different man named Jacob is listed as being Joseph’s father in Matthew’s genealogy.
