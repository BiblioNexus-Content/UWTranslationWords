throne, enthroned
=================

Definition:
-----------

A throne is a specially\-designed chair where a ruler sits when he decides important matters and listens to requests from his people.

* A throne is also a symbol of the authority and power that a ruler has.
* The word “throne” can also be used to refer to the ruler, his reign, or his power.
* In the Bible, God was often portrayed as a king who sits on his throne. Jesus was described as sitting on a throne at the right hand of God the Father.
* Jesus said that heaven is God’s throne. One way to translate this could be, “where God reigns as king.”

(See also: authority, power, king, reign)
