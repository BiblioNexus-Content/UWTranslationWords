## Heaven (id: 26683)

heaven, sky, heavens, heavenly
==============================

Definition:
-----------

The term that is translated as “heaven” usually refers to where God lives. The same word can also mean “sky,” depending on the context.

* The term “heavens” refers to everything we see above the earth, including the sun, moon, and stars. It also includes the heavenly bodies, such as far\-off planets, that we can’t directly see from the earth.
* The term “sky” refers to the blue expanse above the earth that has clouds and the air we breathe. Often the sun and moon are also said to be “up in the sky.”
* In some contexts in the Bible, the word “heaven” could refer to either the sky or the place where God lives.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* For “kingdom of heaven” in the book of Matthew, it is best to keep the word “heaven” since this is distinctive to Matthew’s gospel.
* The terms “heavens” or “heavenly bodies” could also be translated as “sun, moon, and stars” or “all the stars in the universe.”
* The phrase, “stars of heaven” could be translated as “stars in the sky” or “stars in the galaxy” or “stars in the universe.”
