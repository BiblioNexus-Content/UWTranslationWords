## Curtain (id: 26491)

curtain
=======

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, the term “curtain” refers to a very thick, heavy piece of material used in the making of the tabernacle and the temple.

* The tabernacle was built using four layers of curtains for the top and sides. These curtain coverings were made of cloth or animal skins.
* Cloth curtains were also used to form a wall surrounding the tabernacle courtyard. These curtains were made out of “linen” which was a kind of cloth made out of the flax plant.
* In both the tabernacle and temple building, a thick cloth curtain hung between the holy place and the most holy place. It was this curtain that was miraculously torn into two parts when Jesus died.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Since modern\-day curtains are very different from the curtains used in the Bible, it may be more clear to use a different word or to add words that describe the curtains.
* Depending on the context, ways to translate this term could include, “curtain covering” or “covering” or “piece of thick cloth” or “animal skin covering” or “hanging piece of cloth.”
