## Hades (id: 26667)

Hades, Sheol
============

Definition:
-----------

The terms “Hades” (in Greek) and “Sheol” (in Hebrew) are proper names for the place where the spirits of dead people would go after they had died.

* In these ancient cultures, people thought of this as an underground dwelling place where the spirits of dead people existed in a shadowy, semi\-conscious form.
* Although these terms are place names, in the Bible they often mean the same thing as "death" or "the grave."
* Throughout most of biblical history, “Sheol” and “Hades” refer to a neutral place where all of the dead go to await judgment, both the righteous and the unrighteous. In the New Testament, however, “Hades” begins to be seen as a place for only the unrighteous, in contrast with “Abraham's side” (Luke 16:22\) or “paradise” (Luke 23:43\), which describe the place for the righteous.

Translation Suggestions
-----------------------

* Both “Sheol” and “Hades” can be translated in various ways, depending on the context. Some possibilities include: “place of the dead,” “place for dead spirits,” “the underworld,” “the pit,” “the grave,” or “death.”
* Some translations keep the proper names “Sheol” and “Hades,” spelling them to fit the sound patterns of the language of translation. (See: How to Translate Unknowns).
* A phrase could also be added to each term to explain it. Examples of doing this are, “Sheol, place where dead people are” and “Hades, place of death.”
