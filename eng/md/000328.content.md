## First Born (id: 26600)

firstborn
=========

Definition:
-----------

The term “firstborn” refers to an offspring of people or animals that is born first, before the other offspring are born.

* In the Bible, “firstborn” usually refers to the first male offspring that is born.
* In Bible times, the firstborn son was given a place of prominence and twice as much of his family inheritance as the other sons.
* Often it was the firstborn male of an animal that was sacrificed to God.
* This concept can also be used figuratively. For example, the nation of Israel is called God’s firstborn son because God gave it special privileges over other nations.
* Jesus, the Son of God is called God’s firstborn because of his importance and authority over everyone else.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* When “first\-born” occurs in the text alone, it could also be translated as “firstborn male” or “firstborn son,” since that is what is implied. (See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information)
* Other ways to translate this term could include “the son who was born first” or “the eldest son” or “the number one son.”
* When used figuratively to refer to Jesus, this could be translated with a word or phrase that means “the son who has authority over everything” or “the Son who is first in honor.”
* Caution: Make sure the translation of this term in reference to Jesus does not imply that he was created.
