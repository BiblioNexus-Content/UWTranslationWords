* Since most non\-Jewish people in the Roman Empire spoke Greek, Gentiles are often referred to as “Greeks” in the New Testament, especially when contrasted with Jews.
* The phrase “Grecian Jews” or “Hellenists” referred to Jews who spoke Greek in contrast to the “Hebraic Jews” who spoke only Hebrew, or perhaps Aramaic. The term “Hellenists” comes from the pronunciation of the Greek word for a Greek\-speaker.
