## Law (id: 26815)

law, principle
==============

Definition:
-----------

A “law” is a legal rule that is usually written down and enforced by someone in authority. A “principle” is a guideline for decision\-making and behavior, and is usually not written down or enforced. However, sometimes the term “law” is used to mean a “principle.”

* A “law” is similar to a “decree,” but the term “law” is generally used to refer to something written rather than spoken.
* Both “law” and “principle” can refer to a general rule or belief that guides a person’s behavior.
* This meaning of “law” is different from its meaning in the term “law of Moses,” where it refers to commands and instructions that God gave the Israelites.
* When a general law is being referred to, “law” could be translated as “principle” or “general rule.”
