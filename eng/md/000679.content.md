## Pharisee (id: 26953)

Pharisee
========

Facts:
------

The Pharisees were an important, powerful group of Jewish religious leaders in Jesus’ time.

* Many of them were middle class businessmen and some of them were also priests.
* Of all the Jewish leaders, the Pharisees were the most strict in obeying the Laws of Moses and other Jewish laws and traditions.
* They were very concerned about keeping the Jewish people separated from the influence of the Gentiles around them. The name “Pharisee” comes from the word to “separate.”
* The Pharisees believed in life after death; they also believed in the existence of angels and other spiritual beings.
* The Pharisees and Sadducees actively opposed Jesus and the early Christians.
