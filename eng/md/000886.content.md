## Threshold (id: 27159)

threshold, doorway
==================

Definition:
-----------

The term “threshold” refers to the bottom part of a doorway or the part of a building that is just inside the door.

* Sometimes a threshold is a strip of wood or stone that must be stepped over in order to enter a room or building.
* Both a gate and the opening to a tent can also have a threshold.
* This term should be translated with a term in the project language that refers to the place at the very entrance to a home that a person steps across.
* If there is no term for this, “threshold” could also be translated as “doorway” or “opening” or “entranceway,” depending on the context.

(See also: gate, tent)
