## Fruit (id: 26618)

fruit, fruitful, unfruitful
===========================

Definition:
-----------

The term “fruit” refers to the part of a plant that can be eaten. Something that is “fruitful” produces a lot of fruit. Something that is “unfruitful” does not produce fruit.

* In general, the expression “fruit of” refers to anything that comes from or that is produced by something else. For example, the phrase “the fruit of every tree” refers to the fruit that comes from these trees.
* The expression “fruit of the land” refers generally to everything that the land produces for people to eat. This includes not only fruits such as grapes or dates, but also vegetables, nuts, and grains.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* It is best to translate the term “fruit” using the general word for “fruit” that is commonly used in the project language to refer to the edible fruit of a fruit tree. In many languages it may be more natural to use the plural “fruits” whenever it refers to more than one fruit.
* When used literally, the term “fruitful” could be translated as “producing much fruit.”
* The expression “fruit of the land” could also be translated as “food that the land produces” or “food crops that are growing in that region.”
* When used literally, the expression “will be more fruitful” could also be translated as “will produce more fruit.”
