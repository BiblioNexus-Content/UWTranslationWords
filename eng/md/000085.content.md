## Babylon (id: 26358)

Babylon, Babylonia, Babylonian
==============================

Facts:
------

The city of Babylon was the capital of the ancient region of Babylonia, which was also part of the Babylonian Empire.

* Babylon was located along the Euphrates River, in the same region where the Tower of Babel had been built hundreds of years before.
* Sometimes the word “Babylon” refers to the entire Babylonian Empire. For example, the “king of Babylon” ruled the entire empire, not just the city.
* The Babylonians were a powerful people group who attacked the kingdom of Judah and kept the people in exile in Babylonia for 70 years.
* Part of this region was called “Chaldea” and the people living there were the “Chaldeans.” As a result, the term “Chaldea” was often used to refer to Babylonia. (See: synecdoche)
