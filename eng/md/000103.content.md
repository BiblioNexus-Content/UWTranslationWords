------

Beelzebul is another name for Satan, or the devil. It is also sometimes spelled, “Beelzebub.”

* This name literally means “lord of flies” which means “ruler over demons.” But it is best to translate this term close to the original spelling rather than translate the meaning.
* It could also be translated as “Beelzebul the devil” to make it clear who is being referred to.
* This name is related to the name of the false god “Baal\-zebub” of Ekron.
