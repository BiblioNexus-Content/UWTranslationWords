exhort, exhortation
===================

Definition:
-----------

The term “exhort” means to strongly encourage and urge someone to do what is right. Such encouragement is called “exhortation.”

* The purpose of exhortation is to persuade other people to avoid sin and follow God’s will.
* The New Testament teaches Christians to exhort each other in love, not harshly or abruptly.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Depending on the context, “exhort” could also be translated as “strongly urge” or “persuade” or “advise.”
* Make sure the translation of this term does not imply that the exhorter is angry. The term should convey strength and seriousness, but should not refer to angry speech.
* In most contexts, the term “exhort” should be translated differently than “encourage,” which means to inspire, reassure, or comfort someone.
* Usually this term will also be translated differently from “admonish,” which means to warn or correct someone for his wrong behavior.
