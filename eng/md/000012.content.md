## Acacia (id: 26285)

acacia
======

Definition:
-----------

The term “acacia” is the name of a common shrub or tree growing in the land of Canaan in ancient times; it is still plentiful in that region today.

* The orange\-brown wood of the acacia tree is very hard and durable, making it a useful material for building things.
* This wood is highly resistant to decay because it is so very dense that it keeps out water, and it has natural preservatives that keep insects from destroying it.
* In the Bible, acacia wood was used to build the tabernacle and the ark of the covenant.
