forgive, forgiven, forgiveness, pardon, pardoned
================================================

Definition:
-----------

To forgive someone means to not hold a grudge against that person even though they did something hurtful. “Forgiveness” is the act of forgiving someone.

* Forgiving someone often means not punishing that person for something he has done wrong.
* This term can be used figuratively to mean “cancel,” as in the expression “forgive a debt.”
* When people confess their sins, God forgives them based on Jesus’ sacrificial death on the cross.
* Jesus taught his disciples to forgive others as he has forgiven them.

The term “pardon” means to forgive and not punish someone for his sin.

* This word has the same meaning as “forgive” but may also include the meaning of a formal decision to not punish someone who is guilty.
* In a court of law, a judge can pardon a person found guilty of a crime.
* Even though we are guilty of sin, Jesus Christ pardoned us from being punished in hell, based on his sacrificial death on the cross.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Depending on the context, “forgive” could be translated as “pardon” or “cancel” or “release” or “not hold against” (someone).
* The term “forgiveness” could be translated by a word or phrase that means “practice of not resenting” or “declaring (someone) as not guilty” or “the act of pardoning.”
* If the language has a word for a formal decision to forgive, that word could be used to translate “pardon.”
