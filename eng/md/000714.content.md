## Propitiation (id: 26988)

propitiation
============

Definition:
-----------

The term “propitiation” refers to a sacrifice that is made to satisfy or fulfill the justice of God and to appease his wrath.

* The offering of the sacrificial blood of Jesus Christ is the propitiation to God for mankind’s sins.
* Jesus’ death on the cross appeased God’s wrath against sin. This provided a way for God to look on people with favor and offer them eternal life.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* This term could be translated as “appeasement” or “causing God to forgive sins and grant favor to people.”
* The word “atonement” is close in meaning to “propitiation.” It is important to compare how these two terms are used.

(See also: atonement, everlasting, forgive, sacrifice)
