## Judas Son of James (id: 26785)

Judas son of James
==================

Facts:
------

Judas son of James was one of Jesus’ twelve apostles. Note that he was not the same man as Judas Iscariot.

* Often in the Bible, men with the same name were distinguished by mentioning whose son they were. Here, Judas was identified as the “son of James.”
* Another man named Judas was Jesus’ brother. He was also known as “Jude.”
* The New Testament book called “Jude” was probably written by Jesus’ brother Judas, since the author identified himself as the “brother of James.” James was another brother of Jesus.
* It is also possible that the book of Jude was written by Jesus’ disciple, Judas, the son of James.
