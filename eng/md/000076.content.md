## Atonement Lid (id: 26349)

atonement lid
=============

Definition:
-----------

The “atonement lid” was a slab of gold that was used to cover the top of the ark of the covenant. In many English translations, it is also referred to as an “atonement cover.”

* The atonement lid was about 115 centimeters in length and 70 centimeters in width.
* Above the atonement lid were two gold cherubim with their wings touching.
* Yahweh said that he would meet with the Israelites above the atonement lid, under the outstretched wings of the cherubim. Only the high priest was permitted to meet with Yahweh in this way, as the representative of the people.
* Sometimes this atonement lid has been referred to as a “mercy seat” because it communicates God’s mercy in coming down to redeem sinful human beings.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Other ways to translate this term could include “ark covering where God promises to redeem” or “place where God atones” or “lid of ark where God forgives and restores.”
* Can also mean “place of propitiation.”
* Compare this term with how you translated “atonement,” “propitiation,” and “redemption.”
