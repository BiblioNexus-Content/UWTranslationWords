==============================

Description:
------------

The Old Testament term “day of Yahweh” is used to refer to a future time when God will punish people for their sin.

* The Old Testament term “day of Yahweh” is an expression that many of the prophets use.
* The New Testament term “day of the Lord” usually refers to the day or time when the Lord Jesus will come back to judge people at the end of time.
* This final, future time of judgment and resurrection is also sometimes referred to as the “last day.” This time will begin when the Lord Jesus comes back to judge sinners and will permanently establish his rule.
* The word “day” in these phrases may sometimes refer to a literal day or it may refer to a “time” or “occasion” that is longer than a day.
* Sometimes the punishment is referred to as a “pouring out of God’s wrath” upon those who do not believe.
