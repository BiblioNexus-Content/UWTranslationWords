## Learned Men (id: 26820)

learned men, astrologers
========================

Definition:
-----------

In Matthew’s account of the birth of Christ, the “learned” or “educated” men were the “wise men” who brought gifts to Jesus in Bethlehem sometime after his birth there. They may have been “astrologers,” people who study the stars.

* These men traveled a long way from a country far to the east of Israel. It is not known exactly where they came from or who they were. But they were obviously scholars who had studied the stars.
* They may have been descendants of the wise men who served the Babylonian kings in Daniel’s time and who were trained in many things, including studying the stars and interpreting dreams.
* Traditionally it has been said that there were three wise men or learned men because of the three gifts they brought to Jesus. However, the Bible text does not say how many there were.
