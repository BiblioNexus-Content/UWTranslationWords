## Sow (id: 27113)

sow, sower, plant, planted, replanted, transplanted
===================================================

Definition:
-----------

To “sow” means to put seeds on top of or in the ground in order to grow plants. A “sower” is a person who sows or plants seeds. A “plant” is generally something that grows and is attached to the ground.

* One method of sowing or planting seeds during biblical times was to take handfuls of seeds and scatter them on the ground.
* Farmers would often plow the ground on which they had sown seeds after they had sown the seeds. The reason farmers would plow the ground after they had sown the seed is so that the seed would be covered with soil.
* Sometimes farmers may have plowed the field that they sowed seeds in both before and after sowing seeds.

Translations Suggestions
------------------------

* The term to “sow” could also be translated as to “plant.” Make sure the word or phrase you use to translate this term refers to, or can include, planting seeds by scattering them because this is the method of sowing that Jesus was referring to in his parable in Matthew 13:3–23, Mark 4:2–20, and Luke 8:4–8 where he describes a sower who sowed seeds.
* Other ways to translate “sower” could include “planter” or “farmer” or “person who plants seeds.”
* In English, “sow” is only used for planting seeds, but the English word “plant” can be used for planting seeds as well as larger things, such as trees. Other languages may also use different words, depending on what is being planted.
