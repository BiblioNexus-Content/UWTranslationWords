## Christ (id: 26445)

Christ, Messiah
===============

Facts:
------

The terms “Messiah” and “Christ” mean “Anointed One” and refer to Jesus, God’s Son.

* Both “Messiah” and “Christ” are used in the New Testament to refer to God’s Son, whom God the Father appointed to rule as king over his people, and to save them from sin and death.
* In the Old Testament, the prophets wrote prophecies about the Messiah hundreds of years before he came to earth.
* Often a word meaning “anointed (one)” is used in the Old Testament to refer to the Messiah who would come.
* Jesus fulfilled many of these prophecies and did many miraculous works that proves he is the Messiah; the rest of these prophecies will be fulfilled when he returns.
* The word “Christ” is often used as a title, as in “the Christ” and “Christ Jesus.”
* “Christ” also came to be used as part of his name, as in “Jesus Christ.”

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* This term could be translated using its meaning, “the Anointed One” or “God’s Anointed Savior.”
* Many languages use a transliterated word that looks or sounds like “Christ” or “Messiah.” (See: How to Translate Unknowns)
* The transliterated word could be followed by the definition of the term as in, “Christ, the Anointed One.”
* Be consistent in how this is translated throughout the Bible so that it is clear that the same term is being referred to.
* Make sure the translations of “Messiah” and “Christ” work well in contexts where both terms occur in the same verse (such as John 1:41\).
