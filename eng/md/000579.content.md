## Manasseh (id: 26851)

Manasseh
========

Facts:
------

Manasseh was the older son of Joseph. His descendants became one of the tribes of Israel.

* The name Manasseh is similar to the the Hebrew word meaning “to forget.”
* The tribe of Manasseh was often called the “half\-tribe of Manasseh” because only part of the tribe settled in the land of Canaan, on the west side of the Jordan River. The other part of the tribe settled on the east side of the Jordan.
* One of the kings of Judah was also named Manasseh. King Manasseh was an evil king who sacrificed his own children as burnt offerings to false gods.
* God punished King Manasseh by allowing him to be captured by an enemy army. Manasseh turned back to God and destroyed the altars where idols were worshiped.
* Three other men named Manasseh are mentioned in the Old Testament. One of them was the grandfather of some Danites who were priests for false gods. The other two were men who lived during the time of Ezra and were required to divorce their pagan wives, who had influenced them to worship false gods.
