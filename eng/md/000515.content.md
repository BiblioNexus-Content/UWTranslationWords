## Judge (id: 26787)

judge, judgment
===============

Definition:
-----------

The terms “judge” and “judgment” often refer to making a decision about whether or not something is good, wise, or right. However, these terms can also refer to actions performed by a person as the result of a decision, usually in the context of deciding that something is bad, wrong, or evil.

* The terms “judge” and “judgment” can also mean “to cause harm to” (usually because God has decided a person or nation’s actions are wicked).
* The “judgment of God” often refers to his decision to condemn something or someone as sinful.
* God’s judgment usually includes punishing people for their sin.
* The term “judge” can also mean “condemn.” God instructs his people not to judge each other in this way.
* Another meaning is “arbitrate between” or “judge between,” as in deciding which person is right in a dispute between them.
* In some contexts, God’s “judgments” are what he has decided is right and just. They are similar to his decrees, laws, or precepts.
* “Judgment” can refer to wise decision\-making ability. A person who lacks “judgment” does not have the wisdom to make wise decisions.
