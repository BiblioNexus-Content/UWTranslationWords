In Bible times, pipes were musical instruments made of bone or wood with holes to allow the sound to come out. A flute was a kind of pipe.

* A pipe without any reeds was often called a “flute.”
* A shepherd played a pipe to calm his flocks of sheep.
* Pipes and flutes were used for playing sad or joyful music.
