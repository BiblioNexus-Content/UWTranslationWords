## Apostle (id: 26324)

apostle, apostleship
====================

Definition:
-----------

The “apostles” were men sent by Jesus to preach about God and his kingdom. The term “apostleship” refers to the position and authority of those who were chosen as apostles.

* The word “apostle” means “someone who is sent out for a special purpose.” The apostle has the same authority as the one who sent him.
* Jesus’ twelve closest disciples became the first apostles. Other men, such as Paul and James, also became apostles.
* By God’s power, the apostles were able to boldly preach the gospel and heal people, and were able to force demons to come out of people.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The word “apostle” can also be translated with a word or phrase that means “someone who is sent out” or “sent\-out one” or “person who is called to go out and preach God’s message to people.”
* It is important to translate the terms “apostle” and “disciple” in different ways.
* Also consider how this term was translated in a Bible translation in a local or national language. (See How to Translate Unknowns)
