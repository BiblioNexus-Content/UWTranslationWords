================

Definition:
-----------

A pig is a type of four\-legged, hoofed animal that is raised for meat. Its meat is called “pork.” The general term for pigs and related animals is “swine.”

* God told the Israelites not to eat pig meat and to consider it unclean. Jews today still view pigs as unclean and do not eat pork.
* Pigs are raised on farms to be sold to other people for their meat.
* There is a kind of swine that is not raised on farms but rather lives out in the wild; it is called a “wild boar.” Wild boars have tusks and are considered to be very dangerous animals.
* Sometimes large pigs are referred to as “hogs.”
