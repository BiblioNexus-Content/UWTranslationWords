===========

Definition:
-----------

The term “vine” refers to a plant that grows by trailing along the ground or by climbing trees and other structures. The word “vine” in the Bible is used only of fruit\-bearing vines and usually refers to grape vines.

* In the Bible, the word “vine” almost always means “grapevine.”
* The branches of the grapevine are attached to the main stem which gives them water and other nutrients so that they can grow.
* Jesus called himself the “vine” and called his people the “branches.” In this context, the word “vine” could also be translated as “grapevine stem” or “grape plant stem.” (See: Metaphor)
