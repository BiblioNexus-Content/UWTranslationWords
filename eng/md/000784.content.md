## Satan (id: 27057)

Satan, devil, evil one
======================

Facts:
------

Although the devil is a spirit being that God created, he rebelled against God and became God’s enemy. The devil is also called “Satan” and “the evil one.”

* The devil hates God and all that God created because he wants to take the place of God and be worshiped as God.
* Satan tempts people to rebel against God.
* God sent his Son, Jesus, to rescue people from Satan’s control.
* The name “Satan” means “adversary” or “enemy.”
* The word “devil” means “accuser.”

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The word “devil” could also be translated as “the accuser” or “the evil one” or “the king of evil spirits” or “the chief evil spirit.”
* “Satan” could be translated as “Opponent” or “Adversary” or some other name that shows that he is the devil.
* These terms should be translated differently from demon and evil spirit.
* Consider how these terms are translated in a local or national language.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

* **21:1** The snake who deceived Eve was **Satan**. The promise meant that the Messiah who would come would defeat **Satan** completely.
* **25:6** Then **Satan** showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and all their glory and said, “I will give you all this if you bow down and worship me.”
* **25:8** Jesus did not give in to **Satan’s** temptations, so **Satan** left him.
* **33:6** So Jesus explained, “The seed is the word of God. The path is a person who hears God’s word, but does not understand it, and the **devil** takes the word from him.”
* **38:7** After Judas took the bread, **Satan** entered into him.
* **48:4** God promised that one of Eve’s descendants would crush **Satan’s** head, and **Satan** would wound his heel. This meant that **Satan** would kill the Messiah, but God would raise him to life again, and then the Messiah will crush the power of **Satan** forever.
* **49:15** God has taken you out of **Satan’s** kingdom of darkness and put you into God’s kingdom of light.
* **50:9** “The weeds represent the people who belong to the **evil one**. The enemy who planted the weeds represents the **devil**.”
* **50:10** “When the world ends, the angels will gather together all the people who belong to the **devil** and throw them into a raging fire, where they will cry and grind their teeth in terrible suffering.”
* **50:15** When Jesus returns, he will completely destroy **Satan** and his kingdom. He will throw **Satan** into hell where he will burn forever, along with everyone who chose to follow him rather than to obey God.
