The term “the last days” refers generally to the time which begins with the first coming of Jesus and ends with his second coming and the final day of judgement. The Bible also calls the final day of judgement “the last day.” The phrase “the latter days” is sometimes used in the Bible with the same meaning as the phrase “the last days” but other times it can refer only to a time that is after the time in which the speaker is speaking but before the first coming of Jesus. The term “the last day” refers to the day of final judgement.

* This time period of “the last days” will have an unknown duration.
