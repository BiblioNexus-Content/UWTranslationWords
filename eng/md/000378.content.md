## Golgotha (id: 26650)

Golgotha
========

Facts:
------

“Golgotha” was the name of the place where Jesus was crucified. Its name comes from an Aramaic word that means “Skull” or “Place of the Skull.”

* Golgotha was located outside the city walls of Jerusalem, somewhere nearby. It was perhaps located on a slope of the Mount of Olives.
* In some older English versions of the Bible, Golgotha is translated as “Calvary,” which comes from the Latin word for “skull.”
* Many Bible versions use a word that looks or sounds similar to “Golgotha,” since its meaning is already explained in the Bible text.
