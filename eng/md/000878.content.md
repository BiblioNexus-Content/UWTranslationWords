## Testimony (id: 27151)

testimony, testify, witness, eyewitness, evidence
=================================================

Definition:
-----------

When a person gives “testimony” he makes a statement about something he knows, claiming that the statement is true. To “testify” is to give “testimony.”

* In some places in the Old Testament, “Testimony” refers specifically to the tablets of stone on which Yahweh wrote his ten commandments. From that use it came to refer to God’s law more broadly.
* Often a person “testifies” about something he has experienced directly.
* A witness who gives “false testimony” does not tell the truth about what happened.
* Sometimes the term “testimony” refers to a prophecy that a prophet has stated.
* In the New Testament, this term was often used to refer to how Jesus’ followers testified about the events of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection.

The term “witness” refers to a person who has personally experienced something that happened. Usually a witness is also someone who testifies about what they know is true. The term “eyewitness” emphasizes that the person was actually there and saw what happened.

* To “witness” something means to see it happen.
* At a trial, a witness “gives witness” or “bears witness.” This has the same meaning as “testify.”
* Witnesses are expected to tell the truth about what they have seen or heard.
* A witness who does not tell the truth about what happened is called a “false witness.” He is said to “give false witness” or to “bear false witness.”
* The expression “be a witness between” means that something or someone will be evidence that a contract has been made. The witness will make sure each person does what he has promised to do.
