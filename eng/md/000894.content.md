==============================

Facts:
------

The term “torment” refers to terrible suffering. To torment someone means to cause that person to suffer, often in a cruel way.

* Sometimes the term “torment” refers to physical pain and suffering. For example, the book of Revelation describes physical torment that worshipers of the “beast” will suffer in the end times.
* Suffering may also take the form of spiritual and emotional pain, as experienced by Job.
* The apostle John wrote in the book of Revelation that people who do not believe in Jesus as their Savior will experience eternal torment in the lake of fire.
* This term could be translated as “terrible suffering” or “cause someone to suffer greatly” or “agony.” Some translators may add “physical” or “spiritual” to make the meaning clear.
