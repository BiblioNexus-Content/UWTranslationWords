In Old Testament times, Ai was the name of a Canaanite town located just south of Bethel and about 8 km northwest of Jericho.

* After defeating Jericho, Joshua led the Israelites in an attack of Ai. But they were easily defeated because God was not pleased with them.
* An Israelite named Achan had stolen plunder from Jericho, and God ordered that he and his family be killed. Then God helped the Israelites defeat the people of Ai.
