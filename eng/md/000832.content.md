## Snow (id: 27105)

Facts:
------

The term “snow” refers to white flakes of frozen water that can fall from clouds in places where the air temperature is cold.

* Snow falls in places of higher elevation in Israel, but does not always stay on the ground very long before melting. The peaks of mountains tend to have snow that lasts longer. One example of a place mentioned in the Bible as having snow is Mount Lebanon.
* Something that is very white often has its color compared to the color of snow. For example, in the book of Revelation Jesus’ clothing and hair were described as being “white as snow.”
* The whiteness of snow also symbolizes purity and cleanliness. For example, the statement that our “sins will be as white as snow” means that God will completely cleanse his people from their sins.
* Some languages might refer to snow as “frozen rain” or “flakes of ice” or “frozen flakes.”
* “Snow water” refers to the water that comes from melted snow.
