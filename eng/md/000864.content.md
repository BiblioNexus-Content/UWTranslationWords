Tamar is the name of several different women in the Old Testament. There are also several cities or other places that are named Tamar in the Old Testament.

* One of King David’s daughters was named Tamar; she was the sister of Absalom. Her half\-brother Amnon raped her and left her desolate.
* Absalom also had a daughter named Tamar.
