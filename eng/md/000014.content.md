## Adam (id: 26287)

Adam
====

Facts:
------

Adam was the first person whom God created. He and his wife Eve were made in the image of God.

* God formed Adam from dirt and breathed life into him.
* Adam’s name sounds similar to the Hebrew word for “red dirt” or “ground.”
* The name “Adam” is the same as the Old Testament word for “mankind” or “human being.”
* All people are descendants of Adam and Eve.
* Adam and Eve disobeyed God. This separated them from God and caused sin and death to come into the world.
