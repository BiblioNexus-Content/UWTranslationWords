Gabriel is the name of one of God’s angels. He is mentioned by name several times, in both the Old and New Testaments.

* Another time, while Daniel was praying, the angel Gabriel flew to him and prophesied about what would happen in the future. Daniel described him as a “man.”
* In the New Testament it is recorded that Gabriel came to Zechariah to prophesy that his aged wife Elizabeth would have a son, John.
* Sixth months after that, Gabriel was sent to Mary to tell her that God would miraculously enable her to conceive a child who would be the “Son of God.” Gabriel told Mary to name her son “Jesus.”
