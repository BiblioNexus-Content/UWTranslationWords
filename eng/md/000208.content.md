## Cow (id: 26481)

cow, bull, calf, cattle, heifer, ox
===================================

Definition:
-----------

The terms “cow,” “bull,” “heifer,” “ox,” and “cattle” all refer to a kind of large, four\-legged bovine animal that eats grass.

* The female of this kind of animal is called a “cow,” the male is a “bull,” and their offspring is a “calf.”
* In the Bible, cattle were among the “clean” animals that the people could eat and use for sacrifice. They were primarily raised for their meat and milk.

A “heifer” is an adult female cow that has not yet given birth to a calf.

An “ox” is a type of cattle that is specifically trained to do agricultural work. The plural of this term is “oxen.” Usually oxen are male and have been castrated.

* Throughout the Bible, oxen were depicted as animals tied together by a yoke to pull a cart or a plow.
* Having oxen work together under a yoke was such a common occurrence in the Bible that the phrase to “be under a yoke” became a metaphor for hard work and labor.
* A bull is also a male type of cattle, but it has not been castrated and has not been trained as a work animal.
