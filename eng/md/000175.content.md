## Church (id: 26448)

church, Church
==============

Definition:
-----------

In the New Testament, the term “church” refers to all people who believe in Jesus. Sometimes “church” refers to a part of that larger group who regularly met together in a certain place, such as the “church at Ephesus.”

* This term literally refers to an assembly or congregation of people who were “called out” of the general population to meet together for a special purpose.
* Often the believers in a particular city would meet together in someone’s home to pray together and to hear and discuss scripture. These local churches were given the name of the city such as the “church at Ephesus.”
* In the Bible, “church” does not refer to a building.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The term “church” could be translated as a “gathering together” or “assembly” or “congregation” or “ones who meet together.”
* The word or phrase that is used to translate this term should also be able to refer to all believers, not just one small group.
* Make sure that the translation of “church” does not just refer to a building.
* The term used to translate “assembly” in the Old Testament could also be used to translate this term.
* Also consider how it is translated in a local or national Bible translation. (See: How to Translate Unknowns.)
