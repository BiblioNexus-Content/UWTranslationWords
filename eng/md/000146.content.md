====================

Definition:
-----------

The term “bury” refers to putting an object (usually a dead body) into a hole or other burial place and then covering it with dirt or stones, etc. The term “burial” is the act of burying something, or it can be used to describe a place where something has been buried.

* Often people bury a dead body by placing it into a deep hole in the ground and then covering it with dirt.
* Sometimes the dead body is placed in a box\-like structure, such as a coffin, before burying it.
* In Bible times, dead people were often buried in a cave or similar place. After Jesus died, his body was wrapped in cloths and placed in a stone tomb that was sealed with a large boulder.
* The terms “burial place” or “burial room” or “burial chamber” or “burial cave” always refer to a place where a dead body is buried.
* Other things can also be buried, such as when Achan buried silver and other things that he had stolen from Jericho.
* The phrase “buried his face” usually means “covered his face with his hands.”
* Sometimes the word “hide” can mean “bury” as when Achan hid things in the ground that he had stolen from Jericho. This meant he buried them in the ground.
