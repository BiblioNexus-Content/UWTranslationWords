## Sin (id: 27098)

sin, sinful, sinner, sinning
============================

Definition:
-----------

The term “sin” refers to actions, thoughts, and words that are against God’s will and laws. Sin can also refer to not doing something that God wants us to do.

* Sin includes anything we do that does not obey or please God, even things that other people don’t know about.
* Thoughts and actions that disobey God’s will are called “sinful.”
* Because Adam sinned, all human beings are born with a “sinful nature,” a nature that that controls them and causes them to sin.
* A “sinner” is someone who sins, so every human being is a sinner.
* Sometimes the word “sinners” was used by religious people like the Pharisees to refer to people who didn’t keep the law as well as the Pharisees thought they should.
* The term “sinner” was also used for people who were considered to be worse sinners than other people. For example, this label was given to tax collectors and prostitutes.
