prophet, prophecy, prophesy, seer, prophetess
=============================================

Definition:
-----------

A “prophet” is a man who speaks God’s messages to people. A woman who does this is called a “prophetess.”

* Often prophets warned people to turn away from their sins and obey God.
* A “prophecy” is the message that the prophet speaks. To “prophesy” means to speak God’s messages.
* Often the message of a prophecy was about something that would happen in the future.
* Many prophecies in the Old Testament have already been fulfilled.
* In the Bible the collection of books written by prophets are sometimes referred to as “the prophets.”
* For example the phrase, “the law and the prophets” is a way of referring to all the Hebrew scriptures, which are also known as the “Old Testament.”
* An older term for a prophet was “seer” or “someone who sees.”
* Sometimes the term “seer” refers to a false prophet or to someone who practices divination.
