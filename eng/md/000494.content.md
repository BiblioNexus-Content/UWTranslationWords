## Job (id: 26766)

Job
===

Facts:
------

Job was a man who is described in the Bible as blameless and righteous before God. He is best known for persevering in his faith in God through times of terrible suffering.

* Job lived in the land of Uz, which was located somewhere east of the land of Canaan, possibly near the region of the Edomites.
* It is thought that he lived during the time of Esau and Jacob because one of Job’s friends was a “Temanite,” which was a people group named after Esau’s grandson.
* The Old Testament book of Job tells about how Job and others responded to his suffering. It also gives God’s viewpoint as the sovereign creator and ruler of the universe.
* After all the disasters, God eventually healed Job and gave him more children and wealth.
* The book of Job says that he was very old when he died.
