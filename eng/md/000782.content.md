Definition:
-----------

A sandal is a simple shoe with a flat sole that is held onto the foot by straps that go around the foot or ankle. Sandals are worn by both men and women.

* In ancient Israel, a sandal was sometimes used to confirm a legal transaction, such as the selling of property. One person would take off a sandal and give it to the other person to show that the transaction was legal and binding.
* John said that he was not worthy to even untie Jesus’ sandals, which was a normal task for the servant or slave with the lowest status in a Jewish household.
