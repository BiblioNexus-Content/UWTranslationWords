## Miriam (id: 26881)

Miriam
======

Facts:
------

Miriam was the older sister of Aaron and Moses.

* When she was young, Miriam was instructed by her mother to watch over her baby brother Moses who was in a basket among the reeds of the Nile River. When the pharaoh’s daughter found the baby and needed someone to take care of him for her, Miriam brought her mother to do it.
* Miriam led the Israelites in a dance of joy and thanksgiving after they had escaped from the Egyptians by crossing the Red Sea.
* Years later as the Israelites were wandering in the desert, Miram and Aaron began speaking badly about Moses because he had married a Cushite woman.
* Because of her rebellion in speaking against Moses, God caused Miriam to become sick with leprosy. But later God healed her when Moses interceded for her.
