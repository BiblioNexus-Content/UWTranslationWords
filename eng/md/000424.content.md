Hittite
=======

Definition:
-----------

The Hittites were descendants of Ham through his son Canaan. They became a large empire located in what is now Turkey and northern Palestine.

* Abraham bought a piece of property from Ephron the Hittite so that he could bury his deceased wife Sarah in a cave there. Eventually Abraham and several of his descendants were also buried in that cave.
* Esau’s parents were grieved when he married two Hittite women.
* One of David’s mighty men was named Uriah the Hittite.
* Some of the foreign women that Solomon married were Hittites. These foreign women turned Solomon’s heart away from God because of the false gods they worshiped.
* The Hittites were often a threat to the Israelites, both physically and spiritually.
