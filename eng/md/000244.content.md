## Demon (id: 26516)

demon, evil spirit, unclean spirit
==================================

Definition:
-----------

All these terms refer to demons, which are spirit beings that oppose God’s will.

* God created angels to serve him. When the devil rebelled against God, some of the angels also rebelled and were thrown out of heaven. It is believed that demons and evil spirits are these “fallen angels.”
* Sometimes these demons are called “unclean spirits.” The term “unclean” means “impure” or “evil” or “unholy.”
* Because demons serve the devil, they do evil things. Sometimes they live inside people and control them.
* Demons are more powerful than human beings, but not as powerful as God.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The term “demon” could also be translated as “evil spirit.”
* The term “unclean spirit” could also be translated as “impure spirit” or “corrupt spirit” or “evil spirit.”
* Make sure that the word or phrase used to translate this term is different from the term used to refer to the devil.
* Also consider how the term “demon” is translated in a local or national language. (See: How to Translate Unknowns)
