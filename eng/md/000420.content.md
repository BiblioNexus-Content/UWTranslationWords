## Hezekiah (id: 26692)

Hezekiah
========

Definition:
-----------

Hezekiah was the 13th king over the kingdom of Judah. He was a king who trusted and obeyed God.

* Unlike his father Ahaz, who had been an evil king, King Hezekiah was a good king who destroyed all the places of idol worship in Judah.
* One time when Hezekiah became very sick and almost died, he earnestly prayed that God would spare his life. God healed him and allowed him to live 15 more years.
* As a sign to Hezekiah that this would happen, God performed a miracle and caused the sun to move backwards in the sky.
* God also answered Hezekiah’s prayer to save his people from King Sennacherib of Assyria, who was attacking them.
