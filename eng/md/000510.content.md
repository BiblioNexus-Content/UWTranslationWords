## Judah (id: 26782)

Judah
=====

Facts:
------

Judah was Jacob’s fourth son. He was Leah’s fourth son. His descendants became one of the tribes of Israel.

* The tribe descended from him was known as the “tribe of Judah” or “Judah.”
* His name sounds similar to the Hebrew word meaning “praise.”
* The tribe of Judah settled in the southern part of Canaan, including the mountainous area to the south of the city of Jerusalem. When used as the name of a region of land, the term “Judah” refers to the land given to the tribe of Judah.
* In the Old Testament, the name Judah is sometimes used to refer to the whole southern kingdom of Israel (similar to how the name Ephraim is sometimes used to refer to the whole northern kingdom).
* King David, King Solomon, and all the kings of the southern kingdom were descendants of Judah. Jesus, too, was a descendant of Judah.
* The words “Jew” and “Judea” come from the name “Judah.”
