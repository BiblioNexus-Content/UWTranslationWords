Facts:
------

The term “purple” is the name of a color that is a mixture of blue and red.

* In ancient times, purple was a rare and highly valuable color of dye that was used to dye the clothing of kings and other high officials.
* Because it was costly and time\-consuming to produce this dye, purple clothing was considered a sign of wealth, distinction, and royalty.
* Purple was also one of the colors used for the curtains in the tabernacle and temple, and for the ephod worn by the priests.
* Purple dye was extracted from a kind of sea snail by either crushing or boiling the snails or by causing them to release the dye while still alive. This was an expensive process.
* Roman soldiers put a purple royal robe on Jesus before his crucifixion, to mock him for his claim to be King of the Jews.
* Lydia from the town of Philippi was a woman who made her living by selling purple cloth.
