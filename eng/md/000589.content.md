mediator
========

Definition:
-----------

A mediator is a person who helps two or more people to resolve their disagreements or conflicts with each other. He helps them to become reconciled.

* Because people have sinned, they are God’s enemies who deserve his wrath and punishment. Because of sin, the relationship between God and his people is broken.
* Jesus is the mediator between God the Father and his people, restoring that broken relationship through his death as payment for their sin.
