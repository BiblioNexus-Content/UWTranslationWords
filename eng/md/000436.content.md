Definition:

A horse is a large, four\-legged animal that in Bible times was mostly used for war and for transporting people.

* Some horses were used to pull carts or chariots, while others were used to carry individual riders.
* In the Bible, horses were considered to be valuable possessions and a measure of wealth, mainly because of their use in war. For example, part of King Solomon’s great wealth was the thousands of horses and chariots that he had.
* Animals that are similar to the horse are the donkey and the mule.
* Horses often wear a bit and bridle on their heads so they can be guided.
