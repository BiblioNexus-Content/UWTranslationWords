## Paul (id: 26937)

Paul, Saul
==========

Facts:
------

Paul was a leader of the early church who was sent by Jesus to take the good news to many other people groups.

* Paul was a Jew who was born in the Roman city of Tarsus, and was therefore also a Roman citizen.
* Paul was originally called by his Jewish name, Saul.
* Saul became a Jewish religious leader and arrested Jews who became Christians because he thought they were dishonoring God by believing in Jesus.
* Jesus revealed himself to Saul in a blinding light and told him to stop hurting Christians.
* Saul believed in Jesus and began teaching his fellow Jews about him.
* Later, God sent Saul to teach non\-Jewish people about Jesus and started churches in different cities and provinces of the Roman empire. At this time he started being called by the Roman name “Paul.”
* Paul also wrote letters to encourage and teach Christians in the churches in these cities. Several of these letters are in the New Testament.
