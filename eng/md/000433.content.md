## Hope (id: 26705)

hope, hoped
===========

Definition:
-----------

Hope is strongly desiring something to happen. Hope can imply either certainty or uncertainty regarding a future event.

* In the Bible, the term “hope” also has the meaning of “trust,” as in “my hope is in the Lord.” It refers to a sure expectation of receiving what God has promised his people.
* Sometimes the ULT translates the term in the original language as “confidence.” This happens mostly in the New Testament in situations where people who believe in Jesus as their Savior have the assurance (or confidence or hope) of receiving what God has promised.
* To have “no hope” means to have no expectation of something good happening. It means that it is actually very certain that it will not happen.
