Damascus is the capital city of the country of Syria. It is still in the same location as it was in Bible times.

* During the time of Abraham, Damascus was the capital of the Aram kingdom (located in what is now Syria).
* Throughout the Old Testament, there are many references to the interactions between the inhabitants of Damascus and the people of Israel.
