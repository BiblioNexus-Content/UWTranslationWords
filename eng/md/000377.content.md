## Gold (id: 26649)

gold, golden
============

Definition:
-----------

Gold is a yellow, high quality metal that was used for making jewelry and religious objects. It was the most valuable metal in ancient times.

* In Bible times, many different kinds of objects were made out of solid gold or were covered with a thin layer of gold.
* These objects included earrings and other jewelry, and idols, altars, and other objects used in the tabernacle or temple, such as the ark of the covenant.
* In Old Testament times, gold was used as a means of exchange in buying and selling. It was weighed on a scale to determine its value.
* Later on, gold and other metals such as silver were used to make coins to use in buying and selling
* When referring to something that is not solid gold, but only has a thin covering of gold, the term “golden” or “gold\-covered” or “gold\-overlaid” could also be used.
* Sometimes an object is described as “gold\-colored,” which means it has the yellow color of gold, but may not actually be made of gold.
