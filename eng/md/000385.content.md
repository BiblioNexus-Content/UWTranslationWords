## Governor (id: 26657)

govern, governor, proconsul, Tirshatha
======================================

Definition:
-----------

A “governor” is a person who rules over a large area of land (such as a territory, region, or province) within a nation or empire.

* In the Old Testament, the term “Tirshatha” is a more specific title for a governor who ruled over a Persian province.
* In the New Testament, the term “proconsul” is a more specific title for a governor who ruled over a Roman province.
* In Bible times, governors were appointed by a king or emperor and were under his authority.
* A “government” consists of all the rulers who govern a certain country or empire. These rulers make laws that guide the behavior of their citizens so that there is peace, safety, and prosperity for all the people of that nation.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The word “governor” can also be translated as “ruler” or “overseer” or “regional leader” or “one who rules over a small territory.”
* Depending on the context, the term “govern” could also be translated as “rule over” or “lead” or “manage” or “supervise.”
* The term “governor” should be translated differently than the terms for “king” or “emperor”, since a governor was a less powerful ruler who was under their authority.
* The term “proconsul” could also be translated as “Roman governor” or “Roman provincial ruler.”
