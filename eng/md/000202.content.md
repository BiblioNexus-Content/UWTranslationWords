## Counselor (id: 26475)

advice, advise, advisor, counsel, counselor, counsels
=====================================================

Definition:
-----------

The terms “counsel” and “advice” have the same meaning and refer to helping someone decide wisely about what to do in a certain situation. A wise “counselor” or “advisor” is someone who gives advice or counsel that will help a person make right choices.

* Kings often have official advisors or counselors to help them decide important matters that affect the people they are ruling.
* Sometimes the advice or counsel that is given is not good. Evil advisors may urge a king to take action or make a decree that will harm him or his people.
* Depending on the context, “advice” or “counsel” could also be translated as “help in deciding” or “warnings” or “exhortations” or “guidance.”
* The action, to “counsel” could be translated as to “advise” or to “make suggestions” or to “exhort.”
* Note that “counsel” is a different word than “council,” which refers to a group of people.
