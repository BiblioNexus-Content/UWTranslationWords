## Adultery (id: 26291)

adultery, adulterous, adulterer, adulteress
===========================================

Definition:
-----------

The term “adultery” refers to a sin that occurs when a married person has sexual relations with someone who is not that person’s spouse. Both of them are guilty of adultery. The term “adulterous” describes this kind of behavior or any person who commits this sin.

* The term “adulterer” refers generally to any person who commits adultery.
* Sometimes the term “adulteress” is used to specify that it was a woman who committed adultery.
* Adultery breaks the promises that a husband and wife made to each other in their covenant of marriage.
* God commanded the Israelites to not commit adultery.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* If the target language does not have one word that means “adultery,” this term could be translated with a phrase such as “having sexual relations with someone else’s wife” or “being intimate with another person’s spouse.”
* Some languages may have an indirect way of talking about adultery, such as “sleeping with someone else’s spouse” or “being unfaithful to one’s wife.” (See: euphemism)
