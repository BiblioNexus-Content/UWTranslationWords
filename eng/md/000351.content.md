## Galatia (id: 26623)

Galatia, Galatians
==================

Facts:
------

In New Testament times, Galatia was a large Roman province located in the central part of what is now the country of Turkey.

* Part of Galatia bordered the Black Sea, which was to the north. It was also bordered by the provinces of Asia, Bithynia, Cappadocia, Celicia, and Pamphylia.
* The apostle Paul wrote a letter to the Christians who lived in the province of Galatia. This letter is the New Testament book called “Galatians.”
* One reason that Paul wrote his letter to the Galatians was to emphasize again the gospel of salvation by grace, not by works.
* The Jewish Christians there were incorrectly teaching the Gentile Christians there that it was necessary for believers to keep certain Jewish laws.
