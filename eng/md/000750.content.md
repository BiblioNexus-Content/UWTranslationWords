Rehoboam was one of the sons of King Solomon, and he became the king of the nation of Israel after Solomon died.

* Rehoboam continued as king of the southern kingdom of Judah, which consisted of the remaining two tribes, Judah and Benjamin.
* Rehoboam was a wicked king who did not obey Yahweh, but worshiped false gods.
