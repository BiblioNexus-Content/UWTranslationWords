## Lots (id: 26835)

lots, casting lots
==================

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, a “lot” is a marked object(s) used as a way of making a fair and/or random decision, usually for the purpose of selecting a specific person within a group. “Casting lots” refers to the process of using “lots” to make a fair and/or random decision.

* In modern times, some cultures “draw” or “pull out” lots using a bunch of straws. Someone holds the straws so that no one can see how long they are. Each person pulls out a straw and the one who picks the longest (or shortest) straw is the one who is chosen.
* In biblical times, the objects cast (the “lots”) were probably small marked stones. It is unknown how the “lots” actually indicated a decision, but it probably involved dropping or throwing marked stones on the ground.
* The phrase “casting lots” can be translated as “tossing lots” or “throwing lots” or “rolling lots.” The translation of “cast” should not sound like the lots were being thrown a long distance.
* If a decision is made “by lot,” this could be translated as “by casting lots” or “by throwing lots,” etc.
