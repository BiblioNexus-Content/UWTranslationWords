The term “receive” generally means to get or accept something that is given, offered, or presented.

* To “receive” can also mean to suffer or experience something, as in “he received punishment for what he did.”
* There is also a special sense in which we can “receive” a person. For example, to “receive” guests or visitors means to welcome them and treat them with honor in order to build a relationship with them.
* To “receive the gift of the Holy Spirit” means we are given the Holy Spirit and welcome him to work in and through our lives.
* To “receive Jesus” means to accept God’s offer of salvation through Jesus Christ.
* When a blind person “receives his sight” means that God has healed him and enabled him to see.
