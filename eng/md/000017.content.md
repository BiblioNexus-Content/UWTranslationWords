The terms “adopt” and “adoption” refer to the process of someone legally becoming the child of people who are not his biological parents.

* The Bible uses “adoption” and “adopt” in a figurative way to describe how God causes people to be part of his family, making them his spiritual sons and daughters.
* As adopted children, God makes believers to be co\-heirs with Jesus Christ, giving them all of the privileges of sons and daughters of God.

Translation Suggestions:

* This term could be translated with a term that the language of translation uses to describe this special parent\-child relationship. Make sure it is understood that this has a figurative or spiritual meaning.
* The phrase “experience adoption as sons” could be translated as “be adopted by God as his children” or “become God’s (spiritual) children.”
* To “wait for the adoption of sons” could be translated as “look forward to becoming God’s children” or “wait expectantly for God to receive as children.”
* The phrase “adopt them” could be translated as “receive them as his own children” or “make them his own (spiritual) children.”
