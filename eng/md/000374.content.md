## God (id: 26646)

God
===

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, the term “God” refers to the eternal being who created the universe out of nothing. God exists as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God’s personal name is “Yahweh.”

* God has always existed; he existed before anything else existed, and he will continue to exist forever.
* He is the only true God and has authority over everything in the universe.
* God is perfectly righteous, infinitely wise, holy, sinless, just, merciful, and loving.
* He is a covenant\-keeping God, who always fulfills his promises.
* People were created to worship God and he is the only one they should worship.
* God revealed his name as “Yahweh,” which means “he is” or “I am” or “the One who (always) exists.”
* The Bible also teaches about false “gods,” which are nonliving idols that people wrongly worship.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Ways to translate “God” could include “Deity” or “Creator” or “Supreme Being” or “Supreme Creator” or “Infinite Sovereign Lord” or “Eternal Supreme Being.”
* Consider how God is referred to in a local or national language. There may also already be a word for “God” in the language being translated. If so, it is important to make sure that this word fits the characteristics of the one true God as described above.
* Many languages capitalize the first letter of the word for the one true God, to distinguish it from the word for a false god. Another way to make this distinction would be to use different terms for “God” and “god.” NOTE: In the biblical text, when a person who does not worship Yahweh speaks about Yahweh and uses the word “god,” it is acceptable to render the term without a capital letter in reference to Yahweh (see Jonah 1:6, 3:9\).
* The phrase “I will be their God and they will be my people” could also be translated as “I, God, will rule over these people and they will worship me.”
