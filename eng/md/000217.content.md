## Curse (id: 26490)

curse, cursed, cursing
======================

Definition:
-----------

The term “curse” means to cause negative things to happen to the person or thing that is being cursed.

* A curse can be a statement that harm will happen to someone or something.
* To curse someone can also be an expression of desire that bad things will happen to them.
* It can also refer to the punishment or other negative things that someone causes to happen to someone.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* This term could be translated as “cause bad things to happen to” or “declare that something bad will happen to” or “swear to cause evil things to happen to.”
* In the context of God sending curses on his disobedient people, it could be translated as “punish by allowing bad things to happen.”
* The term “cursed” when used to describe people could be translated as “(this person) will experience much trouble.”
* The phrase “cursed be” could be translated as “May (this person) experience great difficulties.”
* The phrase, “Cursed is the ground” could be translated as “The soil will not be very fertile.”
* However, if the target language has the phrase “cursed be” and it has the same meaning, then it is good to keep the same phrase.
