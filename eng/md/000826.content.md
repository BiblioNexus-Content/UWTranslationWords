## Sin Offering (id: 27100)

sin offering, purification offering
===================================

Definition:
-----------

The “sin offering” was one of several sacrifices that God required the Israelites to offer.

* This offering involved sacrificing a bull, burning its blood and fat on the altar, and taking the rest of the animal’s body and burning it on the ground outside the Israelite camp.
* The complete burning up of this animal sacrifice shows how holy God is and how terrible sin is.
* The Bible teaches that in order for there to be a cleansing from sin, blood must be shed to pay the cost for the sin that was committed.
* Animal sacrifices could not permanently bring about forgiveness of sin.
* Jesus’ death on the cross paid the penalty for sin, for all time. He was the perfect sin offering.
