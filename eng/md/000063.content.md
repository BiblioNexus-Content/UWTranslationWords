## Artaxerxes (id: 26336)

Artaxerxes
==========

Facts:
------

Artaxerxes was a king who reigned over the Persian empire from about 464 to 424 BC.

* During Artaxerxes’ reign, the Israelites from Judah were in exile in Babylon, which was under the control of Persia at that time.
* Artaxerxes allowed Ezra the priest and other Jewish leaders to leave Babylon and go back to Jerusalem to teach the Israelites the Law of God.
* Later during this time, Artaxerxes also allowed his cupbearer Nehemiah to return to Jerusalem to lead the Jews in rebuilding the walls surrounding the city.
* Because Babylon was under the rule of Persia, Artaxerxes was sometimes called the “king of Babylon.”
* Note that Artaxerxers is not the same person as Xerxes (Ahasuerus).
