The term “test” refers to a difficult or painful experience that reveals a person’s strengths and weaknesses.

* God tests people, but he does not tempt them to sin. Satan, however, tempts people to sin.
* God sometimes uses tests to expose people’s sin. A test helps a person to turn away from sin and to draw closer to God.
* Gold and other metals are tested with fire to find out how pure and strong they are. This is a picture of how God uses painful circumstances to test his people.
* To “put to the test” can mean, “challenge something or someone to prove its value.”
* In the context of putting God to the test, it means to try to make him do a miracle for us, taking advantage of his mercy.
* Jesus told Satan that it is wrong to put God to the test. He is the almighty, holy God who is above everything and everyone.
