=======

Definition:
-----------

The term “parable” usually refers to a short story or object lesson that is used to explain or teach a moral truth.

* Jesus used parables to teach his disciples. Although he also told parables to the crowds of people, he did not always explain the parable.
* A parable could be used to reveal truth to his disciples while hiding that truth from people like the Pharisees who did not believe in Jesus.
* The prophet Nathan told David a parable to show the king his terrible sin.
* The story of the Good Samaritan is an example of a parable that is a story. Jesus’ comparison of old and new wineskins is an example of a parable that was an object lesson to help the disciples understand Jesus’ teachings.
